She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

Community translators continue after a release ensuring more translations are on their way. Thank you to everyone who helps to make WordPress available in 205 languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to all of the community volunteers who contribute to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a> by answering questions from WordPress users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more and get involved.

The project believes great software should work with minimum setup, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC2.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, 4, or RC1 on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC2</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks, which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC2 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so that these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a> for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress. If you are new to testing, check out this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">detailed guide</a> that will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for. Which, frankly, if you ever are having a bad day, that is a wonderful place to just kind of wander in and see all of the positive vibes that people are sending around to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, yeah, so the props channel, is always good. Uh, and that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12742\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"People of WordPress: Meher Bala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/people-of-wordpress-meher-bala/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 09:20:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"WordCamp Mumbai\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12706\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"This month\'s People of WordPress feature shares the story of developer and e-commerce builder Meher Bala. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16652:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7809:\"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page.

The company recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/lottiefiles-gets-37m-to-make-the-animation-format-even-more-ubiquitous/\">raised $37M</a> in a Series B round, passed three million users on its website, and is investing in making motion design more accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lottie&#8217;s open source animation file format is used by more than 135,000 designers and developers in websites and apps for Amazon, Google, Spotify, Microsoft, TikTok, Netflix, BBC, Uber, and other high profile companies. The JSON-based format was created by the design team at Airbnb and grew in popularity because of the small file size (600% smaller compared to GIFs), the fact that it is scalable at run-time, and its flexibility to be used across any platform. Lottie files can be used on iOS, Android, web and React Native without modification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>LottieFiles&#8217; new WordPress plugin is available for free on WordPress.org. Once the plugin is installed and activated, it will prompt you to sign into your LottieFiles account or a create a free account. You will also be given the option to share the account with other users and copy Lottie files to the WordPress Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was made for the block editor. Inserting the LottieFiles block will launch a modal window where users can browse recent, featured, and popular Lottie animations. Users can also search through LottieFiles&#8217; library of more than 50,000 animations or access private files from their accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the benefits of using the plugin, as opposed to simply embedding an animation, is that the block settings allow users to easily adjust the Lottie size and background, along with the speed, looping, and controls display.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although block libraries like Kadence Blocks have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kadence-blocks-2-2-4-adds-lottie-animations-block\">support for Lottie animations</a>, LottieFiles&#8217; official plugin is a single-block plugin and includes more block controls. It offers one of the most user friendly ways to insert animations into web pages, blog posts, or any content that could use a little a little motion design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LottieFiles team has been responsive on the support forums and in the reviews so far. In one instance where a user <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-number-of-issues-4/\">reported</a> that the plugin adds its CSS on every page in the front and backend, instead of conditionally adding it when Lotties are displayed, the plugin&#8217;s developers said they are working on minimizing the CSS added to pages. LottieFiles is accepting bug reports and feature requests on their <a href=\"https://feedback.lottiefiles.com/plugin-wordpress\">feedback site</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 02:44:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Dee Teal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12946\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/people-of-wordpress-dee-teal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12388:\"<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people&#8217;s lives for the better. This month we feature a WordPress development and large project specialist on the difference the software and community can make to your career and life.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee-Teal.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12955\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s story with computers started at school in New Zealand where discovering how a mouse worked and learning BASIC and Pascal was a catalyst for what later became a programming career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when computers were just becoming mainstream, there were no opportunities for girls in her school to consider this as a further option. She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" />Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" />Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> \n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones. She has also written about closing the gap between diverse distributed teams and how to meet the challenges of cross cultural remote work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has given talks at WordCamps, including at WordCamp Europe in 2019, on developing ourselves, our relationships, and our communities in increasingly diverse environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a strong desire to share her professional knowledge and experience, Dee hopes her involvement in the WordPress community from being part of a Release Squad in the Core Team, and volunteering in the community through organizing and speaking at WordCamp events, will inspire others to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It’s the connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help and encouragement.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal talking about the community that makes WordPress specialbenefits of the WordPress community</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/dee-wceu2019.png?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee Teal\'s talk at WordCamp Europe 2019 on \'Working a world apart\'\" class=\"wp-image-12958\" /><em>Dee shared her experience with attendees at WordCamp Europe 2019</em>\n\n\n\n<p>In contributing to WordPress and organizing community events around it, Dee found that for her: “At the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters. It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13.2 and free WordPress 6.0 and discussions that are taking place and would need your opinion. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m here today with my special guest and former co-host Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and virtual school contributor. For WordPress 6.0 release co-lead for editor responsible for the merge of the Gutenberg bits and bites into core. Mary Job sends her regards and is taking a break this week. Good evening, Greg. Thank you so much for joining me again tonight. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m great. I&#8217;m so happy that the release went out. Everything works, the work didn&#8217;t collapse, so that&#8217;s great. Also, want to thank you also for being part of the release team and also, I need to mention that I was also a co-lead for the editor with Adam Hevinski, his help was so important to making that happen, because that was a lot of work to bring all the changes from the editor to WordPress core and making sure that everything works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group that helped was so huge. There was, I don&#8217;t know, 20 people, at least helping all the time with different type of tasks, which was an amazing experience to see how everyone cooperates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And also the release team was much bigger. You and the documentation team also having a core lead like Milana, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yeah. So it&#8217;s really interesting to be part of the team and see how it works. Also, the team was bigger than ever, as far as I know, and I think that it still could be bigger. In my opinion. We have so many tasks that are necessary to make all that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; I was on the release course now as a rookie and of course I needed co-leads because as a rookie, you don&#8217;t know what to get yourself into. But there are so many pieces that go into this release and it all has been a mystery and most still are mystery to me. Yeah. But I learned a lot. I learned a lot from all of the people on the release squad. But it&#8217;s also the more I know, the more I know what I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s kind of that really overwhelming feeling that, okay, I have watched so many times, but I still had no idea what is really behind it in all the different pieces that are there. So, and as you said, I&#8217;m in awe of all the brilliant people that make these run smoothly and are always there to help each other out. It&#8217;s an amazing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m glad I did it. It was a lot of work and, but wrangling dev notes, it&#8217;s a unique experience anyway. But yeah, congratulations that you helped bring it over the finish line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, WordPress 6.0, Arturo was released this week named after the contemporary Latino jazz musician, Arturo O&#8217;Farrill with a good Irish name. And there are many features and enhancements that are rolled out with a new version. We talk probably about all of them during the months, leading up to the release on this podcast, we will share again, of course, the release post, and then the field guide with the dev notes. And we will also share two videos with you. One is the release video by the design team. If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet on the about page or in the release post, watch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a great design and cutting from screen to screen, to highlight all the features that are in there. It&#8217;s a great piece of art, so definitely watch it. And then the second video is by Anne McCarthy and she covered the site building process between WordPress 5.0 and WordPress 6.0. 5.0 was released just to repeat that December 6th, 2018. So it&#8217;s three and a half years ago. And in that video, you&#8217;ll see how it changed from the early versions to how you build sites now. It&#8217;s a great, interesting video to watch. If you haven&#8217;t tried out the block editor yet, if you&#8217;re one who hasn&#8217;t started using it yet, I think you will be surprised, or it&#8217;s eye opening to see how it really changed and maybe it intrigues you to start using it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a huge change. How it all has evolved from starting small to edit only the content that&#8217;s post and pages. And throughout all that time, how data change itself, by bringing more tools that are supported and allow you to do more and more things with the content to add some styling and create beautiful designs without using a single line of code. And now even you can create the whole experience. And there&#8217;s many block themes that empower users to edit everything without ever opening and edit or code the detail where you need to deal with PHP files, CSS, and all that big stuff that are becoming more and more complex every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And I think the biggest piece that helps a user to one part be in control, but on the other hand, not have to think about too much about design or the block patterns. And I think they have come really a long way from the first idea of a reusable block that people used this kind of templates or block patterns, but then they were changing it and then they changed it over the whole page site. But now combining just core blocks into this amazing designs and design system, it&#8217;s really remarkable. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s definitely part of that show notes today is that video. And we also shared the article that the WP Tavern posted about that. And then just today I found that Pantheon published an article by yours truly like what to expect from WordPress 6.0. And it goes a little bit more on the developer side. And apart from the enhancements, talk about the enhancements for the writing experience. It&#8217;s more about develop oriented, how to code, with code examples for the new pattern features on pulling in patterns from the directory wire theme, JSON Slug, or also create page layouts on the create page action, and then some block locking examples, and also how to establish those style variations in the theme, JSON. So it&#8217;s a little bit different than the release post on WordPress.org. So, Greg, what are the most intriguing features that you found for WordPress 6.0?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So you already mentioned them, from the coding perspective, you covered how to integrate them on, on the owners of the site. And I think for the user, very exciting possibility is to use style variation when they are provided with theme because everyone have different taste and style variation allow you to quickly change colors, fonts have presets that you can quickly pick one and another, and another until it&#8217;s something that clicks with you and you don&#8217;t have to go and change every setting on the website yourself is just, you have bigger chance to&#8230; The other thing block locking. I think it&#8217;s great and it has a lot of value, but it&#8217;s still missing much more detailed control because everyone can lock and unlock now, which is nice, but you can change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But the idea is that in the future, you could have permission-based rules. So, as a site admin, you could just block everything you want for everyone else or whatever else you would like. So this still needs some development, but it&#8217;s the step in the right direction. And also all the work on patterns that how it evolves. You mentioned that how it was limiting and the beginning, and it was introducing with classic themes in WordPress 5.5. And it didn&#8217;t have so much power because for the content of the post, you don&#8217;t use design so often, but with templates, it&#8217;s just so powerful having a way to insert a footer, a header. And now this is even integrated more contextual. If you use this in line inserter and you are on the bottom of the page, it&#8217;ll propose you some footer patterns in other places, it will propose other patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it tries to be smart and help you to do the right choice. So it&#8217;s no longer, only core blocks in those inline researcher, but also patterns. And yeah, in general, I really like how all the concepts that we already know, they build on top of each other that you mentioned reusable block. So you can now do sort of magic things. You find the block pattern you like, you convert that to reusable block and suddenly you have something you like, and it syncs with all other places the same applies with template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick from the block directory pattern of footer and just magically it&#8217;s there and synced suddenly with all other places. So I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more and more things like that, so people no longer have to worry that they open a new template or new post and they see blank canvas and they don&#8217;t know what to do. Now they open an inserter. There is so much inspiration in there and that you&#8230; it&#8217;s just a different experience. It&#8217;s so much easier to create the same website that you see on the themes demo side than it was before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, well said, Greg. That said, I also like the writing experience. So the favorite feature that I have, it&#8217;s not a big deal, but it&#8217;s actually helping, when you are doing a lot of in-line linking you have the two square brackets, and then you get a list of all the latest posts or pages that you&#8217;ve had. And then you can do in in-line linking for your site. And before you had to kind of look for that and search for it, and what&#8217;s the name of it? And you had to go out and then you had this. Yeah, so this is really nice. And I liked all those keyboard shortcuts that make it, I don&#8217;t have to change from keyboard to mouse and have a very smooth experience yeah. So 6.0 is out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It&#8217;s definitely for experienced users because there are lot more gems like that. Once you discover you never want to go back and you use all the methods. But it takes time, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And then the same, what trips me up. So the WordPress had this for a long time that when you have a highlighted text, and if you have a see a link on the browser and you copy the link and you highlight text, and then you can just Ctrl V you can actually, it uses the URL as a link on that highlighted text. That trips me up everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Especially, so I know that GitHub took it over. Yeah, now when you want to highlight, or have a link there, you highlight the text on that. You have to URL Ctrl V works. Yeah. That&#8217;s really cool. And I use a user note taking app called LogSync. They have taken that on too, but the Google docs, every link I put in Google logs, I have to do twice because it just over click. I can&#8217;t do it anymore. It&#8217;s just so interesting. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Another experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Google docs get on it. We need that there too. Yeah. So another experience that I had during the WordPress 6.0 release cycle, during the beta and release candidates, I used a great plugin that I want to do a shout out for. And it&#8217;s called the Core Rollback Plugin. And it was created by Andy Fragen, who is a long time contributor to WordPress and also part of the beta tester plugin crew. And it allows me to select all the WordPress versions back to 4.0 and install it on a test site. So I was able to test the upgrade from 4.0.23, to 6.0, and does it work or does it bomb?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at first I was a bit disappointed because when I started it, I had a block theme enabled. And of course, then I can only have a WordPress version that actually can handle block theme. So I was only rolling back to 5.9, which didn&#8217;t help me much, but then I realized that, okay, I needed to change the theme. So I changed it to Twenty Ten theme. And then the other part was, how do I get to 4.0? I also needed to change the PHP version to 5.6 and I lose local WP. So that was really interesting. And then it took me maybe a minute or two to install the old version and then upgrade was WCLI to the next version. And that was so fast to test. And then I just went into the site again and did a comment or something like that, just to make sure it works. But that is really, it was very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m sad that I didn&#8217;t know about it before, because sometimes when you had a WordPress install and the new version came out and you were way on the cutting edge, you had a plugin conflict or something like that. And then how do you roll it back to the previous version? And this plugin will save you so much time and headaches. So just make it sure that&#8217;s in your toolbox when you manage other people&#8217;s websites, because it can really help you with that, go back to the safe version within five minutes or so. And wait, the next two weeks till the next version comes out from workers. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also fascinating that warper still supports some old version that to get it working, you need to use PHP version that is no longer even developed like 5.6. But still, if people have that, they can use WordPress, which is mind blowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It totally is. And I think Serge is watching that percentage of users that still use PHP 5.0 very closely, because I think it&#8217;s going to be real soon that WordPress is going to skip it and say, &#8220;okay, yeah, from now on, we are not supporting 5.6 anymore. You got to have to be on 7.4&#8221; or something like that, but it&#8217;s that promise of backwards compatibility and not kicking users out just because they don&#8217;t know they are hosting environment that still uses these old PHP variations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, but this were two interesting weeks. So we had not only WordPress 6.0 come out, but in the last two weeks, we also had two plugin releases. One was 3.2 and the other one was 3.3 and we will cover them both today. So let&#8217;s get started. So Gutenberg 3.2 was released on May 11th and it had a few new features in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was the new preference, persistence API, and we are also happy that it&#8217;s there. Now. It saves now the editor preference in user meta, not in local storage anymore for that the preference handling needed to be revamped before. So we talked about it a little bit in the last episode, but now it&#8217;s here in Gutenberg 13.2. So you won&#8217;t see the welcome guide. You dismiss the welcome guide and it will remember on the site. If you prefer the top toolbar, it will remember. And if you don&#8217;t like the full screen anymore, it will remember, but only on a site basis. So you can access the same site over and over again. And the user settings will be there for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It might be also per editor screen. I mean, if you are on the edit site page might be different and on edit post page or widget page could be different. I don&#8217;t know, because I didn&#8217;t play with that, but I would expect that to happen this way, because in the past, those changes were independent, but it&#8217;s a huge change. We waited for so long to make it happen. It wasn&#8217;t a trivial task, but we finally have that. And it&#8217;s a huge improvement for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely for new users and long time users. Yes. I probably will miss the welcome guide popping up once in a while&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And you can always enable it. There is a setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So in that version also received a visualizer for the panning and margin of all blocks. So when you use the dimension settings of your block, blue outline appears on the screen around the block and expands and contracts, depending on the width of your padding and your margins. And that is really helpful for people that don&#8217;t know what padding and margins are, but they know they want the distance and they want the distance inside or outside. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The other change was for the comment query loop. So there is a new block, which is post comments form. And the idea was to reach the alt experience. When on the post page you would have comments section, which usually is a list of comments and there is also the form. So the form was missing. And now inside the editor, you have something that isn&#8217;t interactive, but just presents a preview of what you will see on the front end. So it&#8217;s on the front end, of course, there will be interactive form that you can use to comment on the website, which is a great change. And that brings the feature priority with the old approach that we had in WordPress 5.9 with the post comments block that is now hidden from the insert it&#8217;s still there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is just to combine those blocks together in the future. So depending on what you use, what the team prefers, whether the new version of the comments log which allows you to move all the pieces around the rapid with group blocks, with all the blocks you can imagine within its template. And the old one is still based on PHP functions that all team authors know from the past, you can provide your own template with template PHP file. There is a lot of hooks, all the things. So I&#8217;m looking forward to see that combined to have a full experience for all the use cases we have for the classic blocks and for the new blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s wonderful. And I, there were about 10 new blocks coming to 6.0, with a common section. And this one, unfortunately it didn&#8217;t make it, but it&#8217;s coming then in 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No we made it, it was so important to bring the same experience that we added that, that was still during beta phase because, the release happens, but that change was already one or two weeks ago so that there was still time to include that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Oh, okay. Excellent. So there&#8217;s a full common suite. Suite of blocks for, for the common settings for themes and templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It also came from user testing during beta phase that people were complaining that they cannot replicate, their old designs without this block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So makes sense to backboard it to 6.0 yes. So we talked about the next version of the quote block and the next version of the list blocks are in experimental stage and you have to switch them on through the experience menu item on the Gutenberg plugin. And now with this release, the quote block version one now has the feature that you can exit the block just by hitting enter we know this from other blocks that works here with the list you have to hit enter twice, out of the block and then a paragraph block and the code block has now too, before you actually had to physically get out of the block by using the mouse or hitting tab or something like that. Yeah. So that&#8217;s really good. So explain to me, Greg, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here. Explain to me, so I&#8217;m at the block API section where now it&#8217;s allowing the custom domain path for the view scripts, assuming that&#8217;s through register that&#8217;s for blocks and that you can have a different path than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s coming, if you ever build the theme or plugin, there is this domain pet metadata field that you can provide. It&#8217;s just when you are using translations, there is a default folder for that inside every WordPress, but as an author of the theme, you can generate all the translations yourself and put it in every folder you want. So because plugin, authors and team authors use that, we added a change that allows to provide the same type of functionality when you are registering view script, it&#8217;s mostly for plugin and team authors. And when they, if they want to have some special JavaScript code that is for many blocks, they add additional functionality, then it&#8217;s going to be useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Excellent. So I know there was something important, but I couldn&#8217;t explain it. Thank you. What&#8217;s also in 13.2, is that the style engine now added typography and color to the back end for the editor so you can, can add it to the block styles and is it for the blocks, Jason, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. As far as I know the study in gen, at least at this stage of development, it&#8217;s mostly about extracting existing code to something that in the future could evolve into something more sophisticated. So it&#8217;s more on the refactor side for now, but it&#8217;s a preparation for bigger things that we have planned for the future with having unified of way of the handing styles for blocks on the PHP and JavaScript side to ensure that it&#8217;s the same on both sides and in the future, we can do interesting things, we will cover that probably with the next release, it might be going in the next release. So one of the changes that recently landed in the Gutenburg is that because of the style in gen, you can only serve CSS styles for blocks that are actually displayed on the page, which is mind blowing that you can can think about all the savings you have because of that, because you exactly know, not only the blocks you used, but also what type of styles were enabled for those blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s the biggest win for this whole refactoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. There&#8217;s a whole discussion about, is of one of the implementation about standardizing, how themes interact with the styling of the blocks and as well as plugins. And I think that&#8217;s also necessary to standardize that in terms of when, when plugins want to introduce new blocks, they need to be able to use the variables that are introduced with the theme JSON file to just seamlessly integrate with, with an existing theme. Yeah. So what&#8217;s, I&#8217;m really sad to see that go. But what was removed was the experimental PWA support for the WP admin, which pretty much was playing around with the idea that you might get an offline and still would be able to write your post and manage your site. There was an experiment by Ella Van Durpe I think. And I think it was a good experiment, but it wasn&#8217;t pursued any further because of course, had other priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: But there is PWA plugin from Google and you can also check it out and it has a lot of similar functionality but for the front end, which is also a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Excellent. Yeah. And I will dig that up and show it in the show notes link in the show notes, the Google PWA plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. And one interesting, I think from the release and being on the team, so together with Adam Janinski, we work on several improvements to the workflow of bringing code from the Google plugin to WordPress core. And we are using NPM packages as a way to share code from Gutenberg and use that directing core. And we introduce a change in workflow that is automated with GitHub actions. So if someone is using GitHub and actions that they know how powerful those tools are. And now we are tagging for the WordPress major release those packages and we can easily update all of them, by using only the distribution tax, little change in the code, but it simplifies so much things inside WordPress core and how the code is shared between those two code bases, which is quite interesting. Someone wants digging into strategies for managing deep projects. I recommend that reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. you should write about those little tools or little ideas that make such a difference on the release of WordPress, because I can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; That other people can really benefit from that. But I think it takes a little bit more strategic approach than just a PR that it has been in the release. Yeah. And the Gutenberg release. So that would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because usually the code you need to write is the easiest part because all the tools are so advanced these days, Github has APIs tools for that. And so it&#8217;s not an issue to code something. The issue is to come up with all the steps, what needs to happen after what, so it works together. So we definitely will be updating documentation for the release team for future releases, how we use the tools we improved and yeah, also for NPM packages, that&#8217;s also something I plan to write to describe how the process has changed with this release and to benefit everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely. So I found with the release that quite a few things have been done by the same people over and over again. Yeah. So the documentation is kind of the shortcuts for them, but if a new person would step in, then it kind of needs a little bit more flesh and strategy kind of yeah. High level information in there. Yeah. So what&#8217;s again, is there anything else in Gutenberg 13.2, we wanted to talk about? I guess that&#8217;s it for 13.2 and we are going right into Gutenberg release 13.3, that was released yesterday. Ryan Welcher wrangled the release over the finish line and posted the release notes. There are comments from 55 contributors among them with their first time contribution. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really good. I was really amazed at the 6.0, sorry. Just digress again. Those WordPress 6.0 release was interesting that there were also 25% of the 500 plus contributors when new contributors, they had never done this before. So it was very interesting. It wasn&#8217;t, as I think previous releases 5.8 and nine were a little bit higher, but still, that&#8217;s a very high number of new contributors and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, the number of contributors is really interesting thing we know for Gutenberg about people who contributed with scope. It&#8217;s now over 900 people and, it&#8217;s only code and there&#8217;s so many more people that help with testing with finding issues, trying to, provide designs, documentation. That&#8217;s a lot. And for core, we don&#8217;t know the exact number for all releases because we have core commuters. So which is a smaller group, like 60 or 70 people only. But I would love to do to get the exact number of people who ever got props for WordPress core, that would be a huge number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, must have been in the tens of thousands of people there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and you said it right. It&#8217;s not only those people that commit code, but it&#8217;s also those who, who argue about the best features, how to approach it. Yeah. and comment on things or review PRs or patches. So yeah. It must be a huge number and it&#8217;s still a huge number if you also consider the people that write documentation, the people that organized meetups, the people, they alone, 780 meetups in the world. Of course, the last two years, they were a little bit crippled because of the pandemic situation, but they will come up again and organizing months over months of meet up Wordcamp meet up, Wordcamp organizers that it&#8217;s just really amazing, people that test things. There are 20 different themes on make.wordpress.org that people could join and see what they can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to do something, just a little pitch here, it&#8217;s the end user documentation team still needs writers. They triage a lot of things and all in GitHub now where you can look for the first night issues, good first issues that you could start writing and help beef up the documentation. And if you are interested in doing just that, feel free to write to me or ping me on slack or on Twitter. And I&#8217;ll have you get onboarded on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s dive into 13.3 release. So the first thing is you can now transform a cover block into a media text block and keep most of the design too. And that&#8217;s fantastic. Because sometimes you want to do that and you couldn&#8217;t. So you had to delete the cover block and start all over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really intriguing how far you can go with transform these days and also how block adjust, because now it&#8217;s not only content, but also a lot of styles and those styles are also, taken from one place from version to another, which is quite a complex thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I tested it in WordPress 6.0 there is this feature where you can transform from a paragraph into a quote block or a list block. And it also keeps background color and text color. And it is really amazing. Yeah. And this transformation from cover to media text did not make it, but it&#8217;s now in the Gutenberg plugin,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m a little bit surprised to see that, but also it&#8217;s a great news that table of contents block is back in the Gutenberg plugin. I mean, it was disabled at some point because it&#8217;s hard to sell. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t ready for pride time for some reasons, but now it&#8217;s back and it&#8217;s still experimental. So that means it still needs some testing, but it&#8217;s really nice, especially for posts where you have a lot of headings because it automatically generates tables of contents, how the name says. And because of that, you will have a nice overview of what&#8217;s inside the post. And it&#8217;s also super handy to be able to go to the section when the post is very long. So that should have a lot of usage on some websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And it automatically detects your headings and creates if they&#8217;re not already in there anchor links for them. That&#8217;s how it works. So you could also use the same anchor links if you want to link from outside of the post, into the post to a certain section. So that&#8217;s definitely a nice side effect for that. And it also does it, if you have on page breaks, it detects the heading over all the pages. And it also can jump from two headings that are on subsequent pages for that post. So it&#8217;s quite sophisticated in the feature set. One feature set that I&#8217;m actually missing is that it automatically creates the table of content as a numbered list. And I have never used a number table of content on a website. So it was always in a bullet list, but I cannot change it back into a bullet list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you have to do is to kind of create a static block out of that. And then it does a bullet list. But it does not update anymore when you add a heading. So then you have to delete it and start all over again. So that&#8217;s a little bit cumbersome, but I think I will file a feature request for that to have it as a real feature I advocated for it, but it didn&#8217;t make it in the first version. So what&#8217;s also interesting actually in this release is that the post terms, you can now add dynamic variations for custom taxonomies. So when you have the post term block, it kind of also lists every taxonomies that are registered with your site. And then the other part, what I really like is that query loop block now has a parents filter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you&#8217;re working with, with a page, you can now use the parent filter to display content from the children of a particular parent page, which eliminates the need for a plugin again. Yeah. I think I need to count all the plugins that I have that I won&#8217;t use anymore because work has it built in, and the place on a list of the sub pages, or you can, even if you have featured images with it, you can even make some nice cards with that on the parent page and show up the next subsequent pages. At the agency. We had quite a few requests for that because some people couldn&#8217;t rock the post kind of post page thing and they always want the pages that&#8217;s so static. They never change, but you want them a different path of discovery and not just through the navigation menu, but also through imagery on the page where it can say, &#8220;okay, now you go here, then here and here and here,” it&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also, the way query loop evolves and how many new features gets with every plugin. It&#8217;s really interesting to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; So let me ask you this, are teams working, or is a team working on the idea that you have a developer ahead who wants to kind of modify the query a little bit more granular than just what you offer through the interface, kind of handled SQL statements or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So to also support SQL, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s on the roadmap mostly because it&#8217;s way too complex and you still can go and code yourself something very custom if you want to right? So it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to replicate, maybe let me put it this way, replace the server implementation of the query loop, the wrapping block and provide your custom query from that. That&#8217;ll be much easier in my opinion than allowing users to start filling with as well and all the square injection, vulnerabilities and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I hear you. It&#8217;s a small thing, but in the new version, you now have tool tips on the split border radios control. So when you&#8217;re in the sidebar work on the border radios, you actually get tool tips where you are actually working on it. Is it the top part of the border or is it the left or the right part or the bottom part? And that&#8217;s really some quality interface and you can actually have a radio separate. And I didn&#8217;t know that, it&#8217;s kind of here now. You can have a radius control just for the left border. Yeah. It&#8217;s a little round, but the other three, they don&#8217;t have a radius at all. And it makes for nice, interesting forms. Now you can do this with Gutenberg in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also like the color controls are now merged with a dropdown component that is a little bit more helpful. It shows when you change the background color to a gradient, it now also shows you in the sidebar when you just open it, what is the current color? And it also shows the gradient instead of just the breakdown color. And you surprised that&#8217;s not the background color that I had. It&#8217;s a gradient. And now you see it all. But the color panel has gotten quite complicated as well. With the same with you click on it and then it comes out and then you have two tabs on there, one the solid color, then the gradient color. And then in the gradient, you can then change the radius and it&#8217;s gotten quite complicated. And I can see that certain things take a little longer or need to be tested first with one block before it&#8217;s rolled out to the other blocks yeah. But that makes also for sometimes it&#8217;s not consistent over all the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But it also makes a lot of sense to combine all those related tools into one. So the sidebar is not so overwhelming for users. So before we had many colors, if you would open that, a year ago, that would be all those things that you see now in this tool table dropdown, they were inside the sidebar, it&#8217;s just the necessary step to organize all that better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I like that curation of settings, then there is for each section heading for the color there&#8217;s on the right end side, sometimes a little too subtle, the three dot menu where you can also switch on and off some features. Yeah. By default, you only see the color for the text for the background, but when you click on the three dot menu, you also see that you could actually manage the link color, but it&#8217;s not offered for every block, but you can switch it on if you need it, for instance, for a quote block or for a list block. But sometimes you need to kind of really go beyond the obvious and click on that three dot menu to find additional features that you knew were there before, but now are a little bit hidden. Yeah, that is&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, but if you are a new WordPress user, I&#8217;m curious how it works, because it might take some time for people to discover that the three dots actually allows you to enable more controls or remove the controls that are there, but they don&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So the same&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Feeling of similar changes, there is one, I would say big change because the block list, the thing you see on the sidebar, but the other side, the one we were talking was on the right side. But on the left side, you can see all the list of all the blocks that are on a given page or template. And that&#8217;s very important for the editing experience, especially for templates where there&#8217;s a lot of nesting involved. And now there is an option in your settings to show openly view as default. So before you have to click a button to open that list, but you can just dock it and it&#8217;ll be there all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I really like that, especially. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. The list view is such an integral part working with templates with all the nested blocks. Yeah. So having that open all the time really cuts down on the load time of the editor and your work workflow when you work quite a few templates or even in, on a normal post. Yeah. But I don&#8217;t think that setting is available for the post editor. I think it&#8217;s only for the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I don&#8217;t know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It&#8217;s only for the site editor it&#8217;s post editor. Well, has that too always open list view. Yeah. So I looked at the preference tables that were in the screenshots. It&#8217;s for both the post editor and for the site editor. Yeah. A lot of people ask me about that when I demoed some of the new features. So what else do we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There&#8217;s there is still no official post with all the change lock files. So we are using something that was prepared earlier. And so we might need to jump a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> To find other items that we have highlighted today. And one of the change is for the heading block. And now we have font family support there. So it was available in other places now it&#8217;s been enabled there for future party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And a lot of people have been waiting for that our user can now change the font family for the heading block and not just the theme developer. And there&#8217;s also a enhancement for the gallery block, but especially for converting a classic block gallery into a gallery block to also include the image caption up until now it didn&#8217;t come over with it. So that&#8217;s definitely a plus for those who converting galleries to gallery blocks. Yeah. And the other two things that are highlighted here are actually part of the table of contents block. And we already talked about that. So I think we are through with that. Was there anything in the three 13.3 that you wanted to point out</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is a lot of items as you rule in the change logs from two releases. And also we discussed work 6.0. So I think we covered a lot today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. But we didn&#8217;t cover all and we never cover all. So dear listeners, definitely check out the change log that will be on the make.Wordpress.org blog when it comes out as a what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 13.3. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Discussed and in the Works</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are at the section, what&#8217;s discussed and what&#8217;s in the works that hasn&#8217;t been released yet? But it&#8217;s definitely top of mind and or discussed quite a bit. So there were some discussions on what keeps theme developers or agency developers who build themes for on taking, for instance, block themes or other features of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those issues come up quite a bit, not quite a bit, but once in a while, and to have some ideas on what would be good for an agency. So one of them was that made it into WordPress 6.0 was for instance, that themes could register blocks. And I think Grzegorz, you were quite instrumental in that to get it fixed or get it implemented that although the recommendation says that blocks are the territory of plugins. But we heard from agencies that we are building custom themes just for that one site implementation that had additional cost also to deploy a theme as well as blocks in plugins to make it available for them. So that was one of the discussions that came out of&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, also the use case was that sometimes themes require some very custom design and this is a way for them to bundle a block that just is targeting that specific theme. And it wouldn&#8217;t make sense in all, all other places. And, but yeah, it&#8217;s not the recommendation blocks belong to plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, but just because it&#8217;s technically possible, doesn&#8217;t have to be, you have to use it, but it&#8217;s available for those who really, really need it. Now, before they had each agency or each freelancer who needed it, came up with their own hacks to make that. And now it&#8217;s just the standard way of using register block type on the theme PHP theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to alleviate some of the adoption hurdles or blockers for adoption there&#8217;s now a new label on the Gutenberg rebuild called focus blocks adoption. And it&#8217;s used on the Gutenberg repo to identify those specific issues that if they would be solved, they could remove the blockers from adopting blocks or block themes. And I think it&#8217;s an interesting concept now to highlight those one of them is one issue. He got that label is by Fabien who has issues C7943 titled allow the usage of block based template parts without using block based templates. And that&#8217;s an interesting idea for classic themes that want to gradually adopt what&#8217;s possible now with the site editor also for their themes and how to implement that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of it is already Grzegorz told me, and Ari has it in the issue is already available since 5.9. But what this particular issue is talking about that it also activate the site editor to edit those template parts without editing any other templates or sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So idea was that if you have a classic theme, you can also provide a template part HTML file that will contain this template particular template part, and that worked, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to edit that. But the proposal is to open the UI for the same, that is inside in block themes for classic themes, which is an interesting way might be a challenge. But the more we open those solutions for classic themes, the better everything becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And it follows the narrative that Matias actually had when he joined us here at the show, after he published the preliminary roadmap of 6.0, when he said that all the things that come with the block theme are not there necessarily to replace how themes work. It&#8217;s more to expand the reach that classic themes can offer to their users or the site owners. And I really like that narrative because it kind of, has that new can come in, but in piece and bits and you don&#8217;t have to adopt it completely, it&#8217;s a gradual adoption. And even in two or three years, you still have a need for classic themes, but there might be a need to open that up for some of the user controls or for the site owners controls. So yeah. Block themes are not replacing or making themes totally redundant. It&#8217;s actually opening up the whole place for new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It also opens an interesting world where you have a block theme, but you&#8217;ll like it, you could switch to the classic block and still retain template parts that you build in your previous theme, it&#8217;s WordPress, everyone can do whatever they like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And now you can do even more and you didn&#8217;t know that you liked it. Yeah. Like gradients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then another discussion that came up now that 6.0 is out Matias Ventura, the lead architect also updated already some of the tracking issues. And I&#8217;m sure there is a new blog post in the making in outlining the roadmap for 6.1. But he already has a site editor and template roadmap tracking issue about 19 tasks. And that&#8217;s about the site editor and how to create template and template parts changes to the interface or updates to the interface to make it for impossible, to edit a template part properties and focus mode. What is a focus mode? It&#8217;s another way of seeing the editor. There&#8217;s also a browse mode coming to the site editor that you look at it from, you just browse the designs, but you&#8217;re not editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. And other things like restricting block editing capabilities, we talked about the block locking at the beginning of the show that comes in 6.0, and that is now that needs to be expanded on. You mentioned that it needs to be role based of course, but also you probably want to lock down the editing part of a footer or header that people can edit it. Not just remove it or move it, but also not edited that is still missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are quite a few in this tracking issue, hints of what&#8217;s to come. And if you&#8217;re curious, we of course share the link in the show notes and what he did for template for the site, edit 10 templates, roadmaps Matias Ventura also published a global style, ongoing roadmap that he updated. And that covers some of the style engine that we talked about. If you want to learn more about it, also the main interface for making changes to the global styles, browsing styles, without having to edit things, web fonts that would just have the web fonts for the style variations right now. But the big part of the web funds API didn&#8217;t make it into 6.0, but it will hopefully make it into 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Also interesting discussion on Twitter where Matias were involved about the future of web phones that maybe openverse could host some web phones and having those open source version of phones, integrated with the WordPress for everyone. That&#8217;s also interesting perspective and general openverse opens so many new ways of reusing content created by other people, which is images, videos, music, and whatever&#8230; Phones. That would be another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and color palettes would actually be also quite interesting. Yeah. So you can swap out the color palette of your theme and just by bringing it in from the openverse. Yeah. Oh, did you see that there&#8217;s a new contributor batch if you added photos to the openverse, to the WordPress photo directory, you can now see that on your profile. Open verse open so many different things for WordPress. It&#8217;s amazing, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I already have this batch. I just checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah me, too</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I Uploaded two photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I think I uploaded four or so but yeah, it doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s a contribution and it will be honored. Yeah. So you have the site editor, the template, the global styles tracking issue. And then the last one is pattern as the section elements. That&#8217;s kind of the next phase for patterns and interesting proof of concept there&#8217;s first a tracking issue. And then James Costa has quite a few little videos and what he kind of considers as a browse mechanism for where you can browse through certain block patterns for the header, for instance, but you see the full page and that will make working on their site so much easier when you&#8217;re actually not only just looking at that section, that&#8217;s visible in your screen, but you can see the full page. And that&#8217;s also available for posts, for instance, or for pages that you create. So there are quite a few things in the works that hopefully make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It, the idea for those sectioning element is really interesting. You mentioned that you can just have the recent exploration is to have zoom out mode. So, you focus on the header and then you get ways to quickly switch the versions of this header by using block patterns or maybe pre-existing template parts, and you just use arrows or something else depending, or how you use that. And how&#8217;s going to maybe implement, and it just quickly switch to another version. Another, until you find something that clicks for you, but it&#8217;s inside the page. It&#8217;s not that you open a model, then you see only just some preview of these things, but you exactly see how it fits to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and so we will share the links to those comments and PRs in the show notes. And if you&#8217;re interested in where things are going, definitely look at those and see what it does for you. And if you have ideas, how it&#8217;s made better or what does not look right or how it can be augmented. Yeah. Chime in now is the time because now people are working on it. And the last discussion that I wanted to point out is that during the FSE program Anne McCarthy did a hallway hangout to talk about the FSE programs and how it works and all that. And then there&#8217;s an issue created or it&#8217;s not an issue, it&#8217;s a discussion post on the developer experience category on the GitHub discussions. And what the full site editing for agency use case is what are the existing features that work that are available and then what are missing features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as well as the features that can be improved, for instance, as a missing features, it identifies the robust permission system for the template editing, as Grzegorz mentioned earlier, or another one is allow editing for only template parts or only specific template parts, but not other parts or other templates that is much more granular. Another interesting thought was that WordPress inland CSS does not always respect the editor font sizes. That might be a bug, but it could also be that some of the mechanics don&#8217;t work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that comes all out of a hangout meeting, which is a hallway hangout meeting is kind of an informal meeting of brains, people that discuss certain things. And this came out of it. I shared the hangout notes, hangout recap, post by Anne McCarthy, as well as this discussion at the GitHub repo. So for all you interested people. All right. So Gregorz, we are at the end of our show. I&#8217;m so glad that you were able to jump in for Mary Job this week and walk us through some of the things. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That was a pleasure to meet with you again and talk about Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And as always the listeners, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. And if you have questions and suggestions or news, you want us to include sent them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a> that&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So this was it from me. Thank you for listening. Thank you for stopping by. I&#8217;m glad you were here and I will talk to you in two weeks. I say goodbye and goodbye, Greg, to you until I see you again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: You for having me, Birgit. It&#8217;s always a pleasure. See you goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yes. And come see us all at Wordcamp Europe. Bye bye.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 28 May 2022 20:45:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Gutenberg Changelog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"BuddyPress: BP Rewrites 1.2.0 maintenance release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=324836\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://buddypress.org/2022/05/bp-rewrites-1-2-0-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:849:\"<p>Immediately available is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bp-rewrites.1.2.0.zip\">BP Rewrites 1.2.0</a>.

The blog where he shared his thoughts on life and tech was starting to get more traffic and he wanted to ensure its future after the b2/cafelog&#8217;s main developer disappeared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg had the vision for what WordPress should be, even before it had a name. It centered on extensibility, a hallmark feature that has made the platform as popular as it is today:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What should it do? Well, it would be nice to have the flexibility of MovableType, the parsing of TextPattern, the hackability of b2, and the ease of setup of Blogger.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg &#8211; <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">The Blogging Software Dilemma</a>, January 24, 2003 </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Textpattern, the interesting new publishing tool at the time, had everything Mullenweg might want in a blogging tool, he wasn&#8217;t sure about its licensing at the time. He decided to fork b2/cafelog, which lives on today in a different form as WordPress, thanks to its GPL licensing. Mike Little joined the effort and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The highlight of this year&#8217;s anniversary celebrations is the <a href=\"https://wp19.day/\">wp19.day</a> website created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dimensionmedia/\">David Bisset</a> and his daughter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\"> Olivia Bisset</a>, who also managed the project. WordPress users and contributors from all over the world left their heartfelt greetings to celebrate the occasion. Reading through, it&#8217;s easy to get a sense of the tremendous good WordPress has done for the world, giving so many a voice, a livelihood, and a chance to live their dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The wp19.day website also featured video submissions from WordPress enthusiasts. Although many first came for the software, the common thread among those who have stayed is the value of the community that has grown up around the project and the leadership it has cultivated. WordCamp and meetup organizer Joe Simpson said WordPress empowered him to take a leadership role in his local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our community here is nurturing &#8211; it&#8217;s a family,&#8221; Simpson said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see where we go from here. Happy birthday, WordPress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg also joined in the fun of celebrating the milestone by contributing his own greeting to the wp19.day project. In his video submission, he said it&#8217;s very rare for a 19-year-old software project and its community to not just still be surviving but actually thriving and &#8220;doing better than ever.&#8221; He thanked contributors of all kinds who have helped people find their way with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\nMatt Mullenweg on WordPress&#8217; 19th Birthday &#8211; video source: <a href=\"http://wp19.day\">wp19.day</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That is a testament to every single person who has ever told a friend about WordPress, participated on the forums, had a translation, contributed code,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Anything that&#8217;s been part of the WordPress ecosystem is part of why WordPress is transforming the web and making it into a place that is more open, more inclusive, more democratic, and a place that we want our future generations to grow up in.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 May 2022 22:12:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Post Status: WooCommerce Function of the Week: add_fee\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=98289\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-function-of-the-week-add_fee/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:321:\"Before we dive in this week\'s function, please note that it\'s usually against any payment provider\'s Terms of Service (like PayPal\'s) to add fees to a transaction based on the customer\'s chosen payment gateway, so please make sure to use &#8220;cart fees&#8221; in a legal way.

Contributions related to creating or supporting (third-party) WordPress themes, plugins, or blocks &#8220;are critical to extending the reach and utility of the WordPress project,&#8221; but they are also in a &#8220;grey area.&#8221; Generally they shouldn\'t be associated with the Five For the Future mission or count toward corporate commitments to the program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the comments, <strong>Adam Warner</strong> asked if <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/05/20/defining-five-for-the-future-pledges-contributions/#comment-90\">completely free code</a> like <strong>Contact Form 7</strong> might be worth counting, and <strong>Brian Gardner</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/05/20/defining-five-for-the-future-pledges-contributions/#comment-91\">asked</a> about contributions to the <strong>Pattern Directory</strong> with <strong>Courtney Robertson</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/05/20/defining-five-for-the-future-pledges-contributions/#comment-94\">chiming in</a> about <strong>CC0</strong> images contributed to <strong>Openverse</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_e17dc8-44\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"managed-wordpress-com\">Managed WordPress(.com) Hosting Starter Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong> has launched <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/05/25/introducing-wordpress-starter-make-your-mark/\">a new plan called &#8220;<strong>WordPress Starter</strong>&#8220;</a> for $5/month.

Some would say — unfavorably — this is an &#8220;Apple-like&#8221; tactic. But Rob\'s right — there\'s an opportunity here for WordPress and Woo:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Let <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Squarespace</strong> and <strong>Wix</strong> duke it out for the low-end market, and do everything you can to help <strong>WooCommerce</strong> corner the market for higher-end, highly custom e-commerce solutions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s also a good opportunity for a &#8220;build a store on a mobile device quickly&#8221; experience now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the new <strong>Fruits</strong> platform — <a href=\"https://fruits.de/\">it seems to do just that</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if something similar existed based on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-wordpress-lite/\">a trimmed-down WordPress install</a>? Want a full store with custom features? Click a button, and it becomes the full <strong>WordPress + Woo</strong> experience ready for customization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christina Warren</strong> and <strong>Dan Knauss</strong> have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status/status/1529962415000940544\">similar thoughts</a> about a <strong>Substack</strong> or <strong>Ghost</strong>-like distribution of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_b00cb9-c0\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-job-titles\">WordPress Job Titles and Skills – Where Do We Stand? (2015-22)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This recent <strong>Woo DevChat</strong>, with <strong>Zach Stepek</strong>, <strong>Till Krüss</strong>, and <strong>Carl Alexander</strong> is a deep, funny, and much more thoughtful (and generously, even inclusive) take on the age-old question &#8220;What is a WordPress Developer?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago this topic was reliable clickbait for much wp-drama because it was often expressed as &#8220;who counts&#8221; or &#8220;who deserves to be called a Developer?&#8221; Will the <em>real</em> developers please stand up? Perspectives have changed and matured a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe today there is such a thing as a &#8220;No-Code Developer&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach, Till, and Carl\'s conversation is <a href=\"https://mariopeshev.com/wordpress-job-titles-skills-stand/\">reminiscent of this 2015 post</a> by <strong>Mario Peshev</strong> and the comment discussion it provoked.

These are events that pull in a community from a geographical area larger than one city or metro area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past years, WordPress Community Support (WCS) saddled regional events with numerous <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/regional-wordcamps/\">additional requirements</a> beyond regular WordCamps, such as preparing a proposal and a minimum of three cities in the region hosting local events, with at least one having hosted a WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Community Team has decided to simplify the guidelines for regional in-person WordCamps,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored WordPress.org community manager Hari Shanker said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Moving forward, regional WordCamps will not need to go through additional steps (such as writing a proposal), and can directly apply to organize a camp for their region&nbsp;<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-organizer-application/\">using the regular WordCamp application form</a>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shanker asummarized community feedback that influenced the decision to ease up on the requirements and move towards using common sense as guide for hosting regional WordCamps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Regional WordCamps could be beneficial in restarting events in a region in a post-pandemic situation. It would be a great way to revive the community.</li><li>WordCamps should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with conditions such as the region, geographic size, country, etc.</li><li>Successful Country-based WordCamps were held in the past, and the community team should not police event organizers based on the region. The event organizing process could be simplified.</li><li>City-based events could be difficult to organize because it’s difficult for a small group to organize a big event. It also causes repetition and a lack of repeat value for sponsors. Regional WordCamps might be a great way to solve this problem.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shanker emphasized that while guidelines are being simplified, it&#8217;s imperative that local meetups are presesrved when regional WordCamps are organized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Local communities offer more accessible ways to connect over WordPress, and more supportive pathways to participation in larger, more complex events,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers who are interested in starting up regional WordCamps are encouraged to continue developing local leadership and will be required to impose a strict, two-year term limit on lead organizers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More simplified guidelines for these events is particularly beneficial in Europe where many smaller countries find that regional WordCamps have a strong unifying effect for their WordPress communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a reason that a &#8216;small country&#8217; like The Netherlands is now in the top of WordPress contributors and companies,&#8221; WordCamp organizer Dave Loodts <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/03/17/discussion-revisiting-in-person-regional-wordcamps/#comment-30060\">commented</a> on the previous discussion. &#8220;It all started in the lap of all the previous&nbsp;WordCamp&nbsp;The Netherlands. Never underestimate the power of these kinds of events.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shanker is requesting feedback on the proposal, particularly on what metrics should be in place to determine the health of regional communities. The proposed change has already started receciving positive feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Switzerland is like the Atlanta metropolitan area in term of population (8 millions vs 6 millions = &#8216;similar&#8217;) and about 10 meetup groups,&#8221; &nbsp;Geneva meetup organizer and WordCamp Switzerland co-organizer Patricia BT <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/05/23/regional-in-person-wordcamps-going-forward/#comment-30158\">commented</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since we had to rename Switzerland to city name after 2015, we knew it was unrealistic to have more than one per year in the country (like if you asked people of Atlanta to have one WordCamp per meetup group) so we moved it from city to city year after year, which was awesome to onboard new organisers, but still missing a &#8216;united&#8217; event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s really cool that we can now go forward with WC Switzerland next year, as I feel we had lost a bit of the &#8216;Swiss community momentum.&#8217; We will recreate that feeling again next year.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 May 2022 18:55:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Post Status: Post Status Upgrade: Group Facilitation Skills\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=98118\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-upgrade-group-facilitation-skills/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2893:\"<p class=\"has-background\">Learn new skills and build your knowledge to enhance your career in WordPress! <strong>Post Status Upgrade</strong> is an ongoing series of live workshops centered around a particular skill or learning activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Post Status\' motto — <strong>Give</strong>, <strong>Grow</strong>, <strong>Together</strong> — is more than just a phrase we repeat a lot.

The Starter plan is $5/month and includes a  custom domain name, along with 6GB storage, and the ability to use payment collection blocks (Donations Form, Premium Content, and Payment Button).</p>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress.com Pricing &#8211; 5/25/2022\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-makes-major-unannounced-pricing-changes-slashes-free-storage-limits\">rolled out major, unannounced pricing changes</a> on April 1, slashing free storage limits, users took to the forums to express their profound disappointment in the controversial update and the company&#8217;s lack of communication around it. After receving overwhelmingly negative feedback, WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-increases-traffic-and-storage-limits-on-new-plans-after-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-on-initial-rollout\">increased traffic and storage limits</a> on the free plan before officially announcing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven weeks after WordPress.com began testing the waters with pricing changes, the company has responded to feedback about the wide gap between the free and Pro plans. Many customers were diappointed to learn that they would have to pay $15/month to have access to custom domain names, even though they do not need the commercial themes and plugins included in the Pro plan. Some users expressed that they felt &#8220;trapped in the net&#8221; with the pricing updates and planned to shift their sites to new platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Starter plan solves some of these customer issues but it is still partially subsidized by advertising. Customers on this plan and the free plan will have ads displayed on their sites. This is different than the legacy Personal plan, which was $4/month for no ads, a custom domain, and the ability to collect payments. The fact that the new Starter plan costs more but doesn&#8217;t remove ads is a point of contention customers mentioned in the comments on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/05/25/introducing-wordpress-starter-make-your-mark/\">announcement</a>. It does, however, include Google Analytics integration, which was previously limited to customers on the legacy Premium plan and higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Starter plan is not meant to be a replacement for the old legacy Personal plan,&#8221; WordPress.com CEO Dave Martin told the Tavern. &#8220;Our goal with every additional pricing iteration that we launch will be to learn something new. The Pro plan and the Starter plan are two of many future iterations that we plan to experiment with.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin also reiterated that customers on the legacy Free, Personal, Premium, Business, or eCommerce plans are able to continue on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[If] you are happy with your current plan, we have no plans to force you to change,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;You can stay on your current plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Finding the right balance between the value that we deliver to our customers and the price that we charge in exchange for that value is something that generally has to be iterated towards. We plan to do just that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, Martin said WordPress.com is aiming to do a better job at communicating important updates to customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I made a mistake with how we communicated the pricing changes with WordPress Pro,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;We listened to feedback from our customers, I took responsibility for it, and then we worked to correct that with this next phase of our pricing change. We’re constantly working to be better at communicating updates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how WordPress.com is evolving its pricing in response the market and WordPress&#8217; changing capabilities. Whereas the legacy plans leaned heavily on selling access to commercial themes, full-site editing has changed the game, giving users more customization power than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is still planning to introduce a range of add-ons for the Starter plan to give customers more flexibility. It&#8217;s possible there will be add-ons for removing ads and adding more storage, but the company still hasn&#8217;t announced what they will offer.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 May 2022 21:54:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: #28 – Mark Root-Wiley on Creating Standards for CSS in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=134775\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/28-mark-root-wiley-on-creating-standards-for-css-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61298:\"<p>On the podcast today we have Mark Root-Wiley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark builds<a href=\"https://mrwweb.com\"> WordPress websites for nonprofits</a> in Seattle, Washington, USA with a focus on accessibility and usability.

Hello Mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Hello. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are really, really welcome. I always like to begin the podcast with a bit of orientation. I think it&#8217;s very important that the audience gets to know a little bit about our guests. Who they are, what their journey with WordPress is and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So although the question is a little bit generic, I&#8217;m going to ask it anyway. Please, just give us a little bit of a history about yourself specifically in relation to your WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Awesome. Yes, let&#8217;s see. It&#8217;s been a pretty long one at this point. I am a child of the web almost. So, even back in the middle grades, I was learning to make websites. And so, it&#8217;s always been my hobby and my passion. And so when I, when I went off to college and got a degree in sociology, of course, that was much less employable than web work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I looked around at all the systems and I had some jobs and internships where I was working with Joomla and Drupal. And so of course I ended up landing on WordPress. So since 2010, I&#8217;ve been here in Seattle, Washington where I build WordPress websites specifically for nonprofits most of the time, and so, my journey has really been that about serving clients, building custom themes doing some custom plugin work, but really like, deep in the world of WordPress for well over a decade now. And, I got to say, I love it and I&#8217;m not considering going anywhere anytime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s excellent news. Now the topic under discussion today is going to be CSS and in particular, we&#8217;re going to reference right at the beginning, an article, which was published by Justin Tadlock on February 22nd on the WP Tavern website. And it was called the case for a shared CSS toolkit in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re going to get into the nuts and the bolts of that in a moment because Mark, I think it&#8217;s fair to say, would like to see some kind of overhaul in the way that WordPress handles CSS. And as I say, we&#8217;ll get into what that means in a moment. But Mark, I know that you may not be able to lay out the history of CSS in WordPress perfectly for us, but clearly you believe there&#8217;s a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just wondering if you could give us any insight that you&#8217;ve got into the way that the legacy of CSS in WordPress has meant that we&#8217;ve got a problem where we are right now. What has been going on and where are we at now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:15] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> It&#8217;s such an interesting question, and I think if I had to boil it down to just one sentence answer, you know, it&#8217;d probably be there used to not be very much CSS in WordPress and now there&#8217;s a whole lot more. To really expand upon that, I think what has happened is, you know, it used to be that WordPress really only had a little bit of front-end markup that it would put out. There were things, HTML for menus, HTML for the search form, HTML for widgets and themers just sort of applied their own CSS to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe in some limited cases, WordPress had a little bit of CSS that they were adding to the front, but really very little. And with the block editor, we saw the project looking to really empower users to be able to control much more design of the sites they build, through the WordPress editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to give people more control over the design, you&#8217;re going to be, at the end of the day, you have to do that with CSS. CSS is the language we use to make design on the web. And so it has just become much, much more complicated. And I think all software, you know, to some extent, right, it&#8217;s always evolving, but I think in our world of open source, that development process can be much messier and much more organic. And I think that that can be a benefit sometimes. But I think that maybe this is one of those instances where, right now there&#8217;s a lot of different ways for accomplishing, you know, similar types of CSS on the front end. Certain blocks handle their CSS in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we&#8217;re just seeing that, you know, it&#8217;s been what, three or four years now of the block editor and there still isn&#8217;t really a strong opinion of sort of, this is the way that the block editor handles CSS and that has made it really hard for, people in my chair. I&#8217;m trying to make themes that are going to work every time I hit the update button on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s just more complex CSS. There&#8217;s more of it. It&#8217;s done in varied ways. With more code comes more complexity and, it&#8217;s time to try to bring some order to that complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s a case of the project being older than it was 15 years ago. There&#8217;s more that&#8217;s been added on top. It&#8217;s like a layer cake. We&#8217;ve had update after update, after update and things have been added in and fiddled with. We&#8217;ve had complete turnarounds in the way the interface has been put together and so on Gutenberg and all of those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, essentially we&#8217;ve now got something which you, I think it&#8217;s fair to say, you would like to have a bit of a reset. You&#8217;d like us to rethink the way that the CSS is handled. And you&#8217;ve got some ideas around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could you give me, before we get into the weeds of it, could you give me examples of pain points that you believe need solving? And you can be as specific as you like, you could describe a particular website that you built and a particular moment where you realized, ah, there&#8217;s things that I wish were different. So pain points that illustrate well what the problem is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:12] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Yeah, that is such a, such a good question. I think that in some ways, the WordPress 5.9 release gave us a brief set of examples that I think made things hard for a lot of us themers. What probably looked like fairly small changes to for instance, the HTML and CSS of the cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was I think one class that was removed from buttons that told you about the orientation of the buttons, how they were vertically aligned. But when that was removed, suddenly all these themes that had written CSS styles where they needed to know the alignment of buttons on their site, they just stopped working because that class had been removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than even really an overhaul, I think it&#8217;s a lot more about refining the practices and making a public commitment to, in the future, we are going to include classes in all of these circumstances, so that you can rely on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to output all of our CSS rules with a certain specificity. It&#8217;s time for the CSS to sort of be better, organized, more consistent, and just communicated better. Which is not really an issue of code, it&#8217;s more matter of having standards for the project. If anything that&#8217;s really what I am hoping to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re not the first person to suggest that this would be a good idea. It feels in the article, at least anyway, you, you make the point that you are standing on the shoulders of giants, really. And do you just want to give a shout out to some of the people who in the past have elucidated what it is that you&#8217;re trying to do? There&#8217;s several of them, but I think it might be nice to give them some credit along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:46] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Absolutely. Yes. I completely agree. I hoped that when I wrote my big blog post, this proposal that I know we&#8217;re going to talk about. What I see as one of the strengths is that there&#8217;s very little original thought in it. It&#8217;s really trying to bring together all these other great ideas from other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it goes back to, and I think you can still find it, the theme user experience standards, or TUX that came from Automattic&#8217;s theme team. And I think they have an example we should talk about in a little while. So, I owe a lot to them. Rich Tabor, I think about two years ago had some really awesome posts about what it would mean if we could standardize how we named font sizes, how we named colors and how we handle spacing and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s a critical thing that we really do want to make happen. That&#8217;s something that I would love to see. And then, I think if you&#8217;re just tooling around on GitHub and following, you know, people who are filing issues and the Gutenberg repository, or writing about it. I certainly think Matias, one of the lead developers of the Gutenberg project has written really, really smart stuff about CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were also I think, a couple of like small folks I want to give shout outs to. Louis herons on Github, talked about having a theme block contract. Things that themers can count on for blocks, making that contract. I love that phrase. I think that is super important. And I think also, uh, Andrew on ocean has written about needing different layers of CSS. And I really liked that idea too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be listening in and they&#8217;ll acknowledge your acknowledgement, which is nice. So the idea really is you want there to be some sort of overarching structure. You want there to be some sort of consistency in the way that things are handled, and that WordPress Core would make moves towards that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this is probably something that you&#8217;re going to have an opinion on, but there are out there already, all sorts of different ways of handling CSS. Frameworks, and what have you, you know. Just off the top of my head written a couple of down here, you know, you&#8217;ve got CSS Grid and Bootstrap and so on, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that that&#8217;s possibly not the approach you want us to go down. You don&#8217;t want to bolt those into WordPress Core?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:52] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Definitely not. Yeah. I think that WordPress has never taken a really strong position on like, this is how your theme code has to be written, and if you&#8217;re going to pull in an entire CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, that&#8217;s way more opinionated. That would be very limiting to anyone who didn&#8217;t want to do things that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think, when I sat down and really thought about like, what is it that I as a themer want. What it was is really baseline standardization more about just making sure that all block HTML and block CSS are done in a similar way. So that they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re sharing styles, they&#8217;re sharing CSS classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there is also a ton of power if we can just standardize key styles that every site is going to need. So colors and font sizes. The amount of space between elements, things like that. But certainly not going as far as something like Bootstrap where there&#8217;s, gosh, sliders and drop down menus and modal dialogues and all those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not at all about that. It&#8217;s really, I think the word I really settled on is it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a toolkit. It&#8217;s providing more tools that all theme developers, all plug in developers, we can all use and share, but we still get to choose how we use them and how much we use them. So that, if we want to play nicely together, you know, those tools are available, but we can still choose to do things in our own way where it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We mentioned at the start that there was a WP Tavern article, which in turn was written because of something that you wrote and I&#8217;m going to include everything that we talk about today as far as possible in the show notes. But if you wish to pause this podcast and go and read Mark&#8217;s piece, it&#8217;s called standardized design tokens and CSS for a consistent, customizable and interoperable WordPress future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to find that over at There&#8217;s no, no hyphens or anything like that. It&#8217;s just M R W web.com. That outlines everything that Mark is talking about. And so that really frames the conversation that we&#8217;re going to have from this moment on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you mentioned that you wanted some sort of standardization. Presumably if that&#8217;s the case, you believe that the standardization at the moment is lacking. It&#8217;s messed up. It&#8217;s a muddle for people to create things. Everybody&#8217;s using their own different ways of doing things. Just kind of outline the specific problems about fragmentation versus standardization. What is it that you&#8217;re trying to overcome? What are the problems in Core that we&#8217;ve got at the moment? Things that need amending. Things that possibly need creating or uncreating?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:35] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;m going to answer your question and I think I want to like start us maybe five years in the future and then walk backwards to get there. in five years, I think we&#8217;re going to see a lot of sites that were built with the early years of the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like now suddenly they&#8217;re needing to move to new themes. And so what does that look like? And, right now what we have are a lot of what I think of as kind of in the moment decisions that have been made. Both by the themer and the editor. Let&#8217;s take the theme or example first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the block editor from day one has always allowed themers to define named font sizes, right? So, they can call them whatever they want. A lot of themers have something like small, medium, large, extra large, I know. Justin Tadlock on the Tavern posted his extensively researched list of font size names that he likes. Definitely worth a read for anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the critical thing is that you can call them whatever you want. You can call them broccoli, apple, bicycle. You can call them seven forty, two ninety six, even if that has nothing to do with their sizes. And so what this means is that if we&#8217;re going to switch to a new theme in the future, if we switched to a theme that uses different names, all those font size settings that were set on the last version of the site are just gone. There is no bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if we could agree to some like naming schemes, whether it is small through large, or even just 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Now, when you move from one theme to another, you&#8217;re going to inherit, the choices that were made by the editors of the site, and be able to keep content as intact as possible. And right now I think the systems that the block editor is giving us are not really encouraging that consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it hasn&#8217;t really bitten us yet. The problems I think are coming. And so when I talk about portability of content. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about is how, what happens when we move from one theme to another. And I think that when you make that process smoother, it&#8217;s because you have good standards and that&#8217;s going to benefit everybody, working all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the idea then is that things would become more standard and hopefully the community as a whole would adopt some standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, although we haven&#8217;t discussed this in our conversation prior to clicking record, I&#8217;m curious about your thoughts about this. Do you have any expectation that this would be something that would be, if you like, top down, in other words, would this be something which you would like to just be reflected in documentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a thing that you could use, or are you looking for a framework for CSS where really there are standards, which must be adhered to. In other words, you don&#8217;t really get to choose. If you want to be a WordPress theme in the repository, then you must do it in such and such a way. And over time, you mentioned five years in the future, we slowly encourage people to become the writers of CSS in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> That is such a tough question. I think that I guess I&#8217;ll say a few different things. I mean, I think that whenever possible, it&#8217;s better to use carrots than sticks. And I think that, right now in fact, I think the theme dot json standard is a great one where, if you&#8217;re building, what we&#8217;re now starting to think of is like classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you can use the theme dot json it&#8217;s on, it&#8217;s up to you and you also get like a ton of benefits by doing it. So I think that if we had standards like this, there would just be tremendous benefits to anyone who uses them, because themes would sort of work more similarly and even, there would be ways where plugins could suddenly sort of start referencing theme styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to think that maybe this could bubble up, and be, you know, a community standard that people want to buy in, but aren&#8217;t forced to buy into. At the same time, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to take to get this moving. Standardizing semantic names is something, we could talk about it forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I know that I personally, like I put out, in my blog post, a bunch of suggestions for the names. I thought really long and hard about them. I have my reasons. And honestly, like if someone said, nope, we&#8217;re going to use this really weird naming scheme that I don&#8217;t really care for anyway, I would use it in a heartbeat. I think having standards is more important than the specific names of them are. And so I do think that, there could be some room for some top-down decision-making here. As long as it&#8217;s a fairly simple thing, and we&#8217;re not going to punish people for not using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress land, you know, maybe that means we&#8217;re going to maybe throw some errors on occasion if you&#8217;re not using, some warnings, excuse me, not errors warnings. But no errors, nothing&#8217;s going to actually quit working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned in the piece that there are some recent issues They were obviously some kind of catalysts for you, where you thought, okay, these kinds of things are happening and it makes it pretty obvious that we need to rethink this. I&#8217;m just going to read them out, and maybe this will give some context to somebody listening to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You say to quote, recent issues make the need for a consistent, transparent approach, clear. Classes that were previously present and used by theme authors have been removed in favor of inline styles. Okay, we&#8217;ll get onto why that&#8217;s bad. Inline styles are redundant, hard to override and remove valuable selectors for theme authors. New instances of important, let&#8217;s just say that, CSS rules catch theme authors by surprise. Markup changes to Core blocks were only announced after the fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know if you want to take all four of those or just riff on generally why you think these are the core things which need to be addressed, but yeah, there&#8217;s obviously something in there that sparked your interest and made you want to create this framework, if you like. Let&#8217;s just talk about that for a minute. Have you got something to say around that? What is it that you&#8217;ve found problematic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> I certainly have things to say. I suspect that honestly, maybe it was just random, how many, how many issues in 5.9 there were that sort of just got my goat as it were. I think that this is maybe one of the areas where there has already been a little bit of movement actually, which is wonderful. So yesterday, was this day when sort of all the dev notes for WordPress 6.0 showed up on the make.wordpress.org/core blog, and it included a lot of announcements about some changes to things, that are coming in WordPress 6.0. And I think that that advanced notice, already feels like, maybe some of what I&#8217;ve been saying has been heard and, and that, that is really great to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, there&#8217;s going to be some changes to like how images get aligned, the quote blocks CSS, some changes around the group block in the block editor. And, I&#8217;m really happy to see that communication. So I do think that some of these smaller things were addressed, but I also think that the fact that some classes disappeared and some markup changed and nobody knew about it, and like important CSS got added. If you ever want to like really get a bunch of people worked up about CSS, just start talking about important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the fact that those all happened at once, I think more than any one specific issue, it just felt like, okay, there&#8217;s a lot of people changing a lot of things all at the same time and there&#8217;s no cohesive vision for we&#8217;re trying to take CSS in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So essentially you want there to be far less surprises in the way that things are released and also to have some cohesive framework that everybody can dip into and everybody understands because it&#8217;s been well-documented and everybody can buy into it. As you said, carrot, not stick, because it just makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article on the WP Tavern website had a very large amount of commentary on it. More so than anything I&#8217;ve seen in quite a while, to be honest, a lot of praise for the idea of what you&#8217;re doing. A lot of people saying, yes, we need this, we need this right now. And to develop it a little bit further, you are, you&#8217;re keen to get involved in a semantic approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that might not be obvious to everybody. So what does that mean? What is it you hope would come out of this? We may have a different vocabulary, in use in the end, but the idea is that we&#8217;re going to be substituting words or not as the case may be. So talk to us a little bit about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:43] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Yeah. I when I&#8217;m talking about semantics here, it&#8217;s really about can we establish shared meanings for some naming conventions within our CSS? So, back to the font size example earlier, if we can all agree that every time we name our font sizes, we&#8217;re going to call them small, medium, and large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every time we create our color palettes, we&#8217;re going to start with a primary color and a secondary color and maybe an accent color. Having that shared meaning, that&#8217;s what semantics are, is going to just provide so many benefits, and it&#8217;s also going to speed things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s going to be less mental overhead, fewer decisions that themers have to make. There&#8217;s just tons of value there. Thinking back I had mentioned that the theme user experience standards were maybe the best spiritual forbearer to this kind of point of the proposal. One of the things they recommended is when you&#8217;re naming your menu positions to call them menu one, menu two, menu three, menu four. Maybe that&#8217;s not what I would have chosen, but I started doing it and I&#8217;ve done it ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what it means is that any time I switched one of my themes to another themes that uses that same menu naming convention, like, the same main menu just popped up in the header, right where I would want it to be without me having to update any settings at all, just because, our themes knew how to talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really about, can we make our themes and plugins talk to each other better and, ironically or, or appropriately, I think that just means we all need to do a bit more communication together in the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s get into weeds of the areas you think ought to be covered off, with some kind of framework. I keep using the word framework. I hope that&#8217;s okay. So for example, you mentioned fonts and you mentioned that the fonts might have things like small, medium, large, and that could probably extend up and down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also there&#8217;s obviously other things in CSS that we would like to cover. So before we get into nomenclature of what those things might be, let&#8217;s just talk about the things that you want to cover aside from fonts. What other things do you think are so essential that we need to have a standard that everybody just understands?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:47] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Great question. So in terms of those kinds of like standard things that we should name, I think beyond font sizes, including font weights, because if you&#8217;ve ever used a font, you know, that some have nine or now in infinite number of weights. So we need a way to sort of have a standardized font scale. Colors and gradients I had mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, that&#8217;s something where WordPress already lets us name our colors and gradients. So let&#8217;s just agree to always call them the same things. I think font families. So what are you using for your copy versus what you&#8217;re using for your heading? And then I would love to also see maybe some border widths, and probably the biggest one that I am most excited about is let&#8217;s agree on one or a few named scales for spacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the space between blocks in a post, also the space between columns. The space between a gallery. If we can all agree on those names, then we can have a gallery with small space, a gallery with large space. And that&#8217;s just always going to look good from theme to theme, even though those values are going to be different and up to the themer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So aside from the fact that you would like to take into account things like font sizes and weights, colors, gradients, font, families, borders, spacing gaps, and so on columns and what have you. There would obviously need to be things that are associated with those, and you, you mentioned font sizes, small, medium, and large. Do you have some sort of insight into how far each of these go? Let&#8217;s for example take font sizes or weights? Well, let&#8217;s go for font sizes just for illustrative purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How far would you like to take that, and do you have a system for making it so that it can be extendable indefinitely? So an example might be, one dash large or something like that, or XL large or something like that. Just give us a flavor of how far that scale would go down as well as up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:39] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. So I think, if it were up to me, if I were making a top-down decision, I think I would just pick a scale of numbers. Either, you know, starting at zero or going up, or maybe even centered around zero with positive and negative numbers. I like the fact that you don&#8217;t need to know English to use a scale like that, and it is infinitely scalable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the other scaling systems that a lot of people really like is what&#8217;s often called a t-shirt sizing. So instead of small, medium and large, we would just have S M and L. And the nice thing about that one is you can infinitely go in either direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So XL, XXL, XXXL. It gets a little silly after a while, but you can do it. Some people like to say like three XL instead of XXXL. And you can do the same with XS, extra small. I will say that I think that when it comes to what WordPress should be standardizing, I don&#8217;t think it makes sense for us to say that every theme needs to have a 15 point scale for font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some themes are gonna want three or five and that will be fine. I like to think of, of the 80 20 rule. 80% of needs out in the world can be satisfied by only 20% of the possible names in this case, that we could come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that for something like font sizes, a seven point scale, maybe would probably meet everybody&#8217;s needs in terms of switching from site to site, and keeping things looking pretty good. Again, to go back to sort of like why I like to think of this as a tool kit. I wouldn&#8217;t want to ever say that themes can only have seven font sizes. Right. It would just be that if they want more than that, they&#8217;re on their own to go figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say that I did, I did a lot of thinking about this even after my blog post. And there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a demo I put together that was showing how maybe we could even have a way of having really big scales that could kind of shift down to only a three point scale, or maybe you want to have a five point scale, but it skipped 0.4. I think there&#8217;s some clever things you can do with CSS custom properties that could allow that to happen. So you can find that demo in the blog blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I ran that demo. That was really useful to look at that. But let&#8217;s move on to colors and much, much more constrained there. You just want a handful really unlike font sizes, which there&#8217;s definitely more scope with colors. You just want a few basic standards that will satisfy most websites I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:56] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s right. And I think that the more colors that we defined, probably the more disagreement there would be. What purpose does the fifth most important color in your palette have versus what purpose does the primary or secondary colors have in your palette?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that, especially for colors, I think it&#8217;s the best example where if you had a bunch of standards, they probably wouldn&#8217;t actually be that useful. So let&#8217;s just, let&#8217;s keep it simple, right? Let&#8217;s not, over-complicate this. Let&#8217;s make as few things we all need to agree on as possible. So hopefully we can actually agree on them and move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The font weights and the font size is obviously really dramatically changed the way a website looks. And if you switch from theme to theme and those get messed up, it really can look remarkably different. And you mentioned spacing, so gaps and columns and padding and margin and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it can really catastrophic effect things. What was a very small space can become a gigantic gulf, given a change in theme and so on, and so I was just wondered let&#8217;s ask the basic question again. What kind of constraints are you placing on that? How many different things do you think you need regarding spacing and gaps and all of that? Are we looking at dozens of different options or just three or four?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> My first thought was, we probably only need maybe five, and I think that that probably would be about enough. If someone wants to do a few more than that, that would be fine. I think that spacing is maybe a really good example of the other key reason why I would love to see themes like shifting to these scales, because right now, for the most part, when an editor wants to change the spacing, of something in their posts, they can, you know, set a specific margin value or a specific padding value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can say, I want the top margin of this image to be 24 pixels. And they&#8217;re making that decision based on how their content looks in that moment, on their screen with that specific theme. Let&#8217;s say design trends again in five years are like really into white space. Maybe that 24 pixels is going to look super tiny all of a sudden. So if we can allow editors instead of having to pick a number and on the next page, they forget that they entered 24. And so they entered 20. And like now there&#8217;s just chaotic numbers all over the place. If we just say like, well, at the top of this image, I want to have a large margin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when they move to their next theme, it&#8217;s going to be not 24 pixels, it&#8217;s going to be whatever that is in the next theme. It&#8217;s always going to look cohesive. And so I think it&#8217;s really important to point out that it&#8217;s not just about standardizing the scales for theme developers, but I think if we provide these scales as options for customizing post content, we&#8217;re going to see editors just having to like not think so specifically, and that&#8217;s actually going to enable them to be more consistent, both in the moment and in the future, when they need to sort of switch their design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In a sense, you&#8217;ve read my mind because my next question was really about that because obviously your doing this for a living, you can probably come up with some naming system, some framework that works for you, and just keep executing that over and over again. But, that&#8217;s not the world. We live in the world where you&#8217;ll probably take over a website in a few years&#8217; time that somebody else built, and it will be littered with CSS classes and CSS styling, specific to that exact one little thing on that one page and how on earth did that happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it did. And so you need to go back and unpick all of the problems. So there&#8217;s that. The developers amongst us have probably figured out a system for themselves over the years, and they&#8217;ve got something which works. But when you swap a website, when you go and take on somebody else&#8217;s work, the fact that there&#8217;s consistency and stability in the naming of things would really help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you mentioned the bit, which I thought was really interesting, about the non-technical users and having things in easy to understand, non-technical language that somebody can just get a hold on and okay. All right. It would appear that that thing, okay, might not be the most obvious name in the world, but right, it does that. And it seems to do that consistently over the site. That just makes sense for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You described them as editors, but it could be anybody touching the website who has the capability to edit things. They, they really don&#8217;t want to get involved with CSS. In fact, that&#8217;s probably their worst nightmare that they need to think about CSS. They just want a handful of things, easy to understand. A minimal array of choices. The styling decisions were made months ago, and I&#8217;m just happy to stick with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:17] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> You probably described that bit better I ever could. And, I think it really gets to this, there are lots of strong feelings about, is WordPress maybe becoming more like a site builder? Is it forgetting about being a content management system?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I truly believe that I think it can be both. And I also think that a lot of the work, especially around full site editing right now, like it has that more site builder mindset. And so I do think it&#8217;s important to remember that not every person with a WordPress site wants that super, super, super fine-grained control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re right. I work with folks that just, they are busy professionals in nonprofits in particular. A lot of the organizations I have, you know, whoever is updating the website that is a teeny tiny part of their job. It&#8217;s probably not even in their job description at all sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t want to be thinking about pixels or ems or if they don&#8217;t even know what MSR right. Can&#8217;t I just have some large space. That&#8217;s all I want, right. And so I think that not only are there these like huge technical advantages behind the scenes, but I really do want to just call out that I think this could actually like, just bring some simplicity to the editor and like help people make good decisions without constraining them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It also provides some kind of muscle memory options as well, in that if you have been working with a WordPress website, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re working for company A over here, and you&#8217;ve been working with a WordPress website, and you go to interview for another job and they say, have you any experience with WordPress website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s fine. I can do that. Then you don&#8217;t need to relearn it over on this site though. That thing does. Okay, that wasn&#8217;t quite expecting that. That&#8217;s a lot bigger than I thought. It makes the whole process of editors moving from one website to another easier as well. So it just seems like a bit of a win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now having said all of that, we&#8217;re 15 years plus into the project. Everybody in the comments on the Tavern article seemed to think this was a cracking idea. You seem to think it&#8217;s a cracking idea, the likes of Rich Tabor, they think it&#8217;s a cracking idea. And yet here we are talking about it as an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s holding us back? What is stopping this gaining momentum if it&#8217;s such a sensible idea? Are we, is the project too limited in time? Are we concentrating on other things? You may not have the answers, but you may have some intuitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:33] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> I guess I would start with, this is, you know, a little off the cuff, just a theory, but I do think that the block editor is written in JavaScript. And so the amount of JavaScript in the WordPress project in the last few years has just exploded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be really clear, that&#8217;s fine. You couldn&#8217;t build the block editor without that level of JavaScript. But I do think it means that a ton of the development is done. When people are thinking in terms of JavaScript, and I will say that, one thing that I&#8217;ve looked for and I don&#8217;t really feel like I&#8217;ve seen a lot of, is people sort of starting with, like, what do we want the output to look like? What is the ideal HTML and CSS to allow a user to select the margins of their images, you know, how do we want to handle that? And then build the interface that&#8217;s going to enable that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like it&#8217;s sort of working the opposite way. If we&#8217;re worried about what is the settings interface going to look like? And then like, we&#8217;ll figure out what the code, to make it actually work on the front end is going to be last. I do think that maybe working backwards a little bit more frequent. What CSS do we want, and now how are we going to make sure that it can be created in a sensible way? I wonder if that would help, because at least to me looking, somewhat from the outside, it doesn&#8217;t seem like folks are working that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now having said all of that, I think it&#8217;s mostly a people and a communication problem. And I think that&#8217;s just harder than tech problems, right? Give someone an infinite amount of time and by themselves they could build the block editor on their own, but they certainly could not organize an entire community to agree on what to call font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just requires folks coming together. And honestly like making compromises and, and trying to think about what&#8217;s best for the community and not just best for themselves. I think that&#8217;s really hard. I think we can do it. I think things like that have happened in the past. I do think that&#8217;s the fundamental issue and so I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know exactly what&#8217;s needed though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, that&#8217;s why I do wonder, could someone maybe make a, a bit of an executive decision on this one and, and just try to say this is happening and we&#8217;re going to be taking comments for this long, and then we&#8217;re going to make a decision and roll with it because we think the advantages to having a system are bigger than the disadvantages to any sort of, in the weeds decision that might make it through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder if it&#8217;s because CSS, of all of the different parts of WordPress. The HTML and the CSS bits, they&#8217;re the easy building blocks, aren&#8217;t they? They&#8217;re the bits that a lot of people can get hold of really quickly. And with a quick flick through some kind of 1 0 1 tutorial, you can get yourself up and running with the basics of font sizing and padding and margins and, and quickly gain an understanding of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so everybody&#8217;s been left to their own devices on that. The theme may very well take care of all of that, of all of that for you. And you may need to adjust absolutely nothing. You&#8217;re entirely happy with the theme and you don&#8217;t dabble. But if on that one particular occasion, you just wished to change that one particular thing you want the, I, don&#8217;t know, the, the heading to be slightly bigger, you just fiddle about and locate the CSS for that and modify it, add something to a style sheet, so on. And it&#8217;s fairly straightforward and it can be done by more or less anybody on their own, but it doesn&#8217;t require any consistency. Naming what you like so long as it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But your approach is, is slightly different. And yeah, it feels as if maybe it&#8217;s not got the momentum at the moment, but it feels like, you know, maybe with things like this happening, your initiative happening, people talking about it more, maybe somebody could take this on. And as you say, maybe at some point it does need somebody on high to make a decision executively and say, okay, we&#8217;re going to concentrate on this and it&#8217;s going to become important. But I don&#8217;t know that any of that is in the roadmap right now. So you may need to keep banging the gong for a little bit longer I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:23] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> I actually, you know, I, I played a lot of percussion growing up, so I love banging a good gong. One thing I noticed is, you mentioned the number of comments on the Tavern post, I certainly got a few comments on my blog post and I published a, sort of a Github issue that the sister of the blog post and it got a lot of comments and, and I do think people are listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s required to sort of get some action steps. But, I will say that, what really made me think that, yes, I, I do think people are listening at this moment is there was a blog post, at this point, I think about a month ago, on the make wordpress.org/core blog called core styles and theme customization, the next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gist of that post is basically like here&#8217;s a bunch of links to get hub issues, please go read them and leave your feedback. The speed of change in an open source project is never going to be what we want it to be. And I really do try to always remember that when I&#8217;m feeling impatient, which is certainly why I wrote this whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do think that, it is important for folks to always be paying attention, always be sharing their mind, because I do think, at some point, especially if a lot of us keep talking about this, like some decisions will get made. And so, you know, make sure if you&#8217;re interested in this, make sure to go leave some comments on, on these issues and keep bumping them up so people can see that they are high priority for a lot of us in the community. I know it&#8217;s not just me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it was quite interesting. The article that you mentioned, the core styles and theme customization, the next steps I was highlighting the bits that were basic replications of everything that you were saying. And quite a lot of the article got highlighted. Let&#8217;s put it that way. So it would seem that, on some level, there is movement here and people are definitely in agreement with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any insight into how this might get revved up and get more interest attached to it? In other words, are you willing to put your best foot forward and become somebody in the vanguard? Like I said, banging the gong. Or do you find that there&#8217;s probably a better way of, have you got any insights into where people could go if they agree with you and want to get involved to make this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:25] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Gosh, it takes everyone in the community weighing in, I think that. One thing I&#8217;ll say is that, you know, I tried to get a lot of people to review my blog post and, even gives me advice on like, how should I publish it and who should I let know about this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I think that if it&#8217;s just me it&#8217;s ineffective. It does need to be a community. And so, you know, I would say I would love to see other people sharing their own proposals even. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t even know if you want to include this part, I don&#8217;t think it can just be me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it&#8217;s pretty silly actually. I published this blog post and then 24 hours later, we had a new baby. I definitely had to fall off the face of the earth and disappear for a while, but I was so thrilled to see other people, saying like, yeah, this is awesome. And here&#8217;s the couple of things I have to add.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a whole lot towards the end of the article where you outline the different problems that your solution may solve. I won&#8217;t list them all now, but all of it kind of makes common sense to me. One can only hope that the ideas that you&#8217;ve suggested go forwards and that people, as a community, can coalesce and come up with an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, you&#8217;re not bound to any one particular way of doing it. It&#8217;s just the mere idea of standardizing things, whether it be named this or that is not important, it would just be nice to have some standard documented that everybody can adhere to and therefore make it a lot easier for all of us to make websites, whether we&#8217;re building them for clients or we&#8217;re just editing and tweaking them ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the concerns that we may have is the stability of WordPress CSS in the future. And I know that you have possible concerns that in the future, for example, Gutenberg blocks, there&#8217;s no requirement for the CSS, the classes, and so on to be the same today as it will be tomorrow or indeed yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in other words, is that a problem, do you think? Is there any problem of consistency where let&#8217;s say that you build something and you ship It, and it goes out to your client. It&#8217;s using blocks, but suddenly unbeknownst to you, the blocks CSS classes all get modified, perhaps ever so slightly, but enough to break things. Is that a concern that you have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:36] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> It really is. And I think that this is one of the biggest things I sort of learned from this intense period of engagement I&#8217;ve been having with the project is that, in discussing this with other people and really closely going through, uh, lots and lots of issues and the Gutenberg Github repository. I found some core development team members really saying that they viewed the HTML markup and the classes and how the CSS has written as essentially like non-public, which is to say you can&#8217;t count on this stuff not changing in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was really shocking to me. And I think for a couple of reasons, I mean, th the first is that, you know, that&#8217;s never how it&#8217;s been in WordPress in the past. The HTML for the comment forum, the HTML for the search forum, like those weren&#8217;t always seen as, you can count on this, there are ways to change it if you need to, but if we&#8217;re going to change this stuff, it&#8217;s going to be a huge deal and you&#8217;ll hear about it in advance, and we&#8217;re really gonna try to avoid that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it felt like, uh, that was a departure from how things had previously been. And also as I&#8217;m someone who I think follows the project, like more closely than average, even though I, you know, I&#8217;m certainly not like a day-to-day contributor, or anything, but this was huge news to me as someone who&#8217;s been working with the block editor for years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least to me, I don&#8217;t even really know that it&#8217;s reasonable to just say that like, well, here&#8217;s a bunch of HTML and CSS. Themers I know you have like your job to do and you need to make changes to this, but like, you can&#8217;t count on it. That doesn&#8217;t really seem fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I certainly don&#8217;t think people are really aware of that. They&#8217;re not going to go in and one day, you know, completely change the image block or the block quote block drastically. I don&#8217;t really think they mean we&#8217;re going to just completely change everything. But I do think it just highlights the need again, to really spend some time focusing on what is the HTML that can serve as best going forward. So we don&#8217;t need to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the CSS classes and the ways of handling CSS styles that we want to commit to now so that we can all just know what&#8217;s coming in the future. And so that when there are changes made, they are a big deal, and people are given lots of advance warning and they can, they can react.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think I&#8217;m seeing more advanced warning in WordPress 6.0, which is awesome. It&#8217;s time to have that conversation about how can we just reduce the number of times we need to make big changes like that. Cause people are going to style HTML, no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I wonder if it&#8217;s a product of the fact that the block editor is now basically a conduit to put in lots and lots of little components. So you might have a paragraph block and you might have a, an image block or a cover block or whatever it might be. You&#8217;ve got all of these different blocks and the functionality of that is not yet a hundred percent certain. In other words, aspects of it could change. And so I wonder if them communicating CSS will change is a product of that. They&#8217;re just not sure exactly what those blocks will look like in a few years time. And if they become radically different, maybe the functionality changes. Let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t, but if it did, some of the CSS may need to change. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:42] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> I think you&#8217;re right on the money there. I mean, the block editor is so much more powerful and I want to be really clear that like, that&#8217;s awesome. Like the folks I work with generally, like love that they can do more complex things like columns, or like finally putting text on top of an image for the cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are good things. And we had to have a more complex system to make that possible. So I&#8217;m not against the complexity, but I just think it&#8217;s really important that the folks who are building the product, don&#8217;t forget about those of us in the real world who, you know, have to make things work every day. And we have, we have new sites we&#8217;re constantly working on, the impact of even what can seem like a really tiny change can be really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bring it all back around, I really do think that if we can have just a few more standards and right, if we can have that kind of contract between themes and blocks, I think we can reduce the amount of times that those kinds of changes happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I totally acknowledge that they&#8217;re going to have to happen every once in a while. If we want to have this like big, nice thing, we&#8217;re going to have to put up with probably more changes. Cause there&#8217;s more things that can change, but, let&#8217;s really, let&#8217;s take a minute and figure out how we can make that as infrequent unpainful as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting your language there. You described it as a big, nice thing. And in a sense it&#8217;s a big, nice thing made up of lots of smaller little nice things. Each of those little nice things is completely independent. And you may not use those on your website, but you may.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s modifications made to the CSS classes and what have you, the downstream effect could be pretty catastrophic. You know, if you&#8217;ve just built 50 websites and they&#8217;re all using the exact same block and some tiny little change affects you 50 times, that&#8217;s suddenly created a lot of work for you that potentially was not even thought about elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:27] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> It has. In some extreme cases, this is maybe the reason why some people are often building custom blocks that really they could just be using the core block, but I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve at least anecdotally heard that folks do that sometimes because they know that their block isn&#8217;t going to change, even if they don&#8217;t want to have to take the time to build it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If people Mark wants to find you. They want to actually reach out to you. You may wish to share a Twitter handle or a website or an email address. Totally up to you. Yeah, any place that you could be found if people are inspired to join you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:58] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Yes. I am M R W web pretty much everywhere. So that&#8217;s, uh, MRW web with two W&#8217;s, uh, I&#8217;m MRW web.com. I&#8217;m M R W web on GitHub and Twitter and in the WordPress Slack and Post Status Slack. All these other places. I have a highly Googleable namee. If you want to come find me, I would love to hear from you I&#8217;m. I am not that hard to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Mark, thank you very much for being on the podcast today. I really appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:28] <strong>Mark Root-Wiley:</strong> Thanks so much for having me. This was a blast Nathan. Great, great questions.

Most notably, users can now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/text-selection-across-multiple-blocks-is-coming-to-wordpress\">select text across multiple blocks</a>, manipulating the highlighted portion as a group while keeping the rest of the content blocks in tact.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/04/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-0-14-april/\">Gutenberg 13.0 Release Post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The List View has been updated to offer a more intuitive display that helps with navigating blocks on a page. Select multiple blocks using keyboard shortcuts, make changes, and drag-and-drop inside the list. List View is closed by default but will expand to the current selection when a block is selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: wordPress 6.0 About Page\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 also introduces a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-0-to-ship-new-block-locking-feature\">new interface for locking blocks</a>, which allows useres to prevent blocks from being moved or removed. It is useful for preventing accidental edits but also for theme developers who want to prevent users from removing blocks inside templates, preserving more complex layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: WordPress 6.0 About Page\n\n\n\n<p>Other block editor improvements include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New Blocks: Avatar, Post Author Biography, Read More, Comments Query Loop, and Stack block</li><li>Type two open brackets <code>[[</code> to quickly access the link menu</li><li>Improved support for preserving unrecognized content in the editor</li><li>Preserve existing styles transforming blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance</li><li>New block style transformation options: Tag Cloud > Categories, Calendar > Archives, Paragraph > Code, and Group > Row</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons will retain the style customizations automatically</li><li>New drop-down based color picker UI</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud</li><li>Instant block style previews</li><li>Featured images <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/featured-cover-blocks-and-the-future-of-binding-data-to-generic-wordpress-blocks\">now available in Cover block</a></li><li>New border controls for more precise control when setting borders</li><li>Transparency levels for colors offers more creative control</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 also introduces a gaggle of new layout controls for page building. Users can now control gaps, margins, typography, and more on multiple blocks inside a Group block. Creating layouts is easier with the ability to position groups of blocks by quickly switching between stack, row, and group variations. The Gallery block is now more flexible with gap support for custom spacing. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Biggest stuff is in the editor itself, and there are many minor but big updates facing the end-user like how: <br /><br />&#8211; we no longer have to rely on group block for block spacings<br />&#8211; we now have row block for horizontal stuff<br />&#8211; visual aids getting better and better.</p>&mdash; Onur Oztaskiran (@onuro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onuro/status/1528897439876497408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 24, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Full-Site Editing Updates: More Templates, More Patterns, and Style Switching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are now available in more places and better integrated with the Site Editor. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/02/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-7-2-march/\">Gutenberg 12.7</a> brought major improvements to the patterns experience by making them easier to discover. The block inserter has been updated to display patterns, as opposed to blocks, when users are editing a template in the post or site editor. It also favors showing patterns when the inserter is at the root level or the content being inserted is between other blocks. WordPress will now show existing template parts, as well as block patterns in the template creation process. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: WordPress 6.0 About Page\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/02/new-features-for-working-with-patterns-and-themes-in-wordpress-6-0/\">register patterns from the official Pattern Directory using theme.json</a>, so that users have quick access to patterns the author has highlighted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 introduces five new template options for full-site editing: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated features of this release is the Style Switcher.

Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

In 2021, OSI&#8217;s board appointed Stefano Maffulli as its first Executive Director, and he is leading the organization in overhauling its web presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the main objectives for OSI in 2022 is to reinforce our communication channels,&#8221; Maffulli said. &#8220;We’re improving the perception of OSI as a reliable, trustworthy organization. The OSI didn&#8217;t have a regular publishing schedule before, nor a content plan. Now we have established a regular cadence, publishing at least once a week (often more), commenting on recent news like a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.opensource.org/gnome-patent-troll-stripped-of-patent-rights/\" target=\"_blank\">winning against a patent troll</a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.opensource.org/modified-agplv3-removes-freedoms-adds-legal-headaches/\" target=\"_blank\">court decisions about open source licenses</a>, featuring our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.opensource.org/category/sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsors</a>, and offering <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.opensource.org/category/opinions/\" target=\"_blank\">opinions</a> on topics of interest for the wider community. It’s a starting point to affirm OSI as a convener of conversations among various souls of the open source communities.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blog was launched on a subdomain of the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">opensource.org</a> website, which uses Drupal 7, self-hosted on a droplet from Digital Ocean. It&#8217;s also tightly integrated with CiviCRM to manage members&#8217; subscriptions, donations from individuals, tracking sponsorships, and sending the newsletter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Drupal 7 is approaching EOL in November 2022, the team is planning to move everything to WordPress. They explored managed hosting with Drupal but found it was more expensive and also required them to migrate to a more recent version of Drupal. Themes and plugins made for D7 are not compatible with D9+, so they didn&#8217;t see an advantage in terms of time or simplicity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately we don&#8217;t have staff to manage a self-hosted Drupal installation and nobody on staff really knows how to use it,&#8221; Maffulli said. &#8220;Tasks like creating landing pages proved to be quite time consuming for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With money, knowledge and time constraints and an urgent need to increase our publishing rate, ramping up the organization’s visibility online we decided to migrate the website in two phases: First, we migrate the blog so we have a fresh look together with the improved publishing schedule. This phase is complete &#8211; the blog is on a managed hosting offered by DreamHost. The second phase is the migration of the rest of the site: this is ongoing with the help of Automattic and will take a few months to complete.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Maffulli wanted to avoid creating a blog under a subdomain, and preferred using the old URL (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://opensource.org/blog.\" target=\"_blank\">opensource.org/blog.</a>..), mixing Drupal self-hosted with a managed WordPress site was not a common use case with straightforward solutions. If the new blog design looks familiar, that&#8217;s because it was inspired by WP Tavern&#8217;s new design.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Open Source Initiative&#8217;s new WordPress-powered blog\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once we decided to go with a subdomain, the new site took really only a few days to launch: I knew I wanted to have a simple site, minimal amount of plugins, no page builders and a very clean design based on WP Tavern, of which I&#8217;m a fan,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Tavern&#8217;s theme wasn&#8217;t yet on GitHub, Maffulli contracted a developer who used WordPress&#8217; new full-site editing features to create a simple child theme based on the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme. He said he is glad overseeing the project gave him a chance to learn the basics of FSE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some members of the OSI staff were already familiar with WordPress, which contributed to the decision to use the software. The wide range of functionality and third-party integrations were also a factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We rely a lot on content calendar solutions that allow to manage schedule posts and social media promotions from one tool,&#8221; Maffulli said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re addicted to CoSchedule. That tool is far from perfect, primarily because it’s not Open Source. But it’s so incredibly powerful and convenient for a small team like us. We track our publishing calendar and tasks with CoSchedule, making it so easy not to miss a beat: every blog post has it’s social media attachment, same with the newsletter, that becomes a blog post for archive. Soon, we’ll add podcasts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maffulli said he wishes the WordPress media library offered a more standardized way of storing and tracking copyright information, like the author, source, and license. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think this unnecessarily exposes WP users to copyright infringement claims where trolls could threaten successfully people who may have not kept their records clean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something to think about for future releases of Instant Images and similar plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OSI team has opted to keep comments closed on posts at this time, since they do not have the capicity to properly moderate comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have a lot of experience managing online communities and I know it can become very time consuming,&#8221; Maffulli said. &#8220;We just don’t have staff but we’re raising funds to solve that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OSI is also looking into creating a way to give its members the privilege of commenting.

(prefix / suffix)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to the function statements — actually, <em>statement</em>, as there is only one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>return get_the_term_list( $product_id, \'product_cat\', $before, $sep, $after );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That really sounds like a WordPress function as there is no mention of &#8220;woo,&#8221; &#8220;wc,&#8221; or any other WooCommerce prefixes. Let\'s look it up in the WordPress developer code reference documentation. (<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_term_list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_term_list/</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function get_the_term_list( $post_id, $taxonomy, $before = \'\', $sep = \'\', $after = \'\' ) {\n    $terms = get_the_terms( $post_id, $taxonomy );\n \n    if ( is_wp_error( $terms ) ) {\n        return $terms;\n    }\n \n    if ( empty( $terms ) ) {\n        return false;\n    }\n \n    $links = array();\n \n    foreach ( $terms as $term ) {\n        $link = get_term_link( $term, $taxonomy );\n        if ( is_wp_error( $link ) ) {\n            return $link;\n        }\n        $links&#91;] = \'&lt;a href=\"\' . esc_url( $link ) . \'\" rel=\"tag\"&gt;\' . $term-&gt;name . \'&lt;/a&gt;\';\n    }\n \n    /**\n     * Filters the term links for a given taxonomy.\n     *\n     * The dynamic portion of the hook name, `$taxonomy`, refers\n     * to the taxonomy slug.\n     *\n     * Possible hook names include:\n     *\n     *  - `term_links-category`\n     *  - `term_links-post_tag`\n     *  - `term_links-post_format`\n     *\n     * @since 2.5.0\n     *\n     * @param string&#91;] $links An array of term links.\n     */\n    $term_links = apply_filters( \"term_links-{$taxonomy}\", $links );  // phpcs:ignore WordPress.NamingConventions.ValidHookName.UseUnderscores\n \n    return $before . implode( $sep, $term_links ) . $after;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple enough — <code>get_the_term_list</code> accepts basically the same parameters we covered above, plus the <code>$taxonomy</code> parameter, which in our case is passed as <code>product_cat</code> to tell WordPress we\'re retrieving WooCommerce product categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>get_the_terms( $post_id, $taxonomy )</code> gets the product ID category objects.</li><li><code>$links</code> array gets filled with the list of categories, each with its own link.</li><li><code>return $before . implode( $sep, $term_links ) . $after</code> gives us the content we need: &#8220;prefix + $links separated with $sep + suffix&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Define a product ID (e.g., 57) — and that\'s all you need to do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call the function:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo wc_get_product_category_list( 57 );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And see the magic happen:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cat1 link, cat2 link, cat3 link, ...</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you have access to the <code>$product global</code>, you can call the function dynamically.

With a quick search through the WooCommerce plugin, I find a single result in <code>\\woocommerce\\templates\\single-product\\meta.php</code>, line 34:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php echo wc_get_product_category_list( $product-&gt;get_id(), \', \', \'&lt;span class=\"posted_in\"&gt;\' . _n( \'Category:\', \'Categories:\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' ) . \' \', \'&lt;/span&gt;\' ); ?&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Which generates this output on my single product page:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"357\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-752x357.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97562\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we know <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> is responsible for showing the list of categories in the single product page where it comes with a prefix (&#8216;Category:\' or &#8216;Categories:\' based on category count) plus the default comma separator and no suffix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s use <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> for our custom development example now and consider a quick case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-case-study\">Case study</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Where could <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> come in handy? Surely, in the shop page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WooCommerce shows the list of products with image, title, price and button. There is no mention of product categories there, so let\'s add them ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1-752x398.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97563\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The custom snippet:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Show Categories | WooCommerce Shop\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @testedwith    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n\nadd_action( \'woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item\', \'bbloomer_show_product_categories\', 9 );\n\nfunction bbloomer_show_product_categories() {\n	global $product;	\n	echo wc_get_product_category_list( $product-&gt;get_id(), \' - \', \'&lt;p&gt;In: \', \' \' . _n( \'category\', \'categories\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' ) . \'&lt;/p&gt;\' );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-2-752x383.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97564\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A few notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I used the <code>woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item</code> hook with priority 9, which is just before priority 10 (the add-to-cart button). TLDR: I\'m outputting the category list above the add to cart button.</li><li>I declare the global <code>$product</code> so that I can access the product ID.</li><li>I then call the <code>wc_get_product_category_list function</code>, with the following parameters:<ul><li><code>$product-&gt;get_id() <strong>-&gt; the product ID</strong></code></li><li><code>\' - \' <strong>-&gt; the separator</strong></code></li><li><code>\'&lt;p&gt;In: \' <strong>-&gt; the prefix</strong></code></li><li><code>\' \' . _n( \'category\', \'categories\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' ) . \'&lt;/p&gt; \' <strong>-&gt; the suffix</strong></code></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s interesting how I reused this line from the single product page, as I mentioned above:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>_n( \'category\', \'categories\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, if <code>count = 1</code> the first string is returned (singular &#8220;category&#8221;), while if <code>count &gt; 1</code> you get the plural &#8220;categories.&#8221; You can see the difference in the last screenshot above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other use cases you have in mind?

Three years and ten major releases have radically changed the site building experience, but it&#8217;s not always easy to see recognize when focused on some of the smaller, iterative changes that slowly add up. Anne McCarthy, WordPress product liaison at Automattic and co-release coordinator for 6.0, has created a short 13-minute video that shows the immense amount of progress contributors have made on site building features.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy takes viewers back in time to WordPress 5.0, released in December 2018, which introduced the block editor and the Twenty Nineteen default theme through the work of 400+ contributors. She demonstrates using the Customizer with the default theme. These were simpler days and it&#8217;s clear now how limited the Customizer was for implementing the most basic changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video contrasts that experience with the upcoming 6.0 release, which features the work of 500+ contributors on features that didn&#8217;t exist three years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy quickly demonstrates the 6.0 site editing experience, swapping out template parts, and showcasing the breadth of the customization available for images, colors, typography, controlling the posts that are displayed, style variations, and the impressive array of design tools available.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Ten major versions later, nearly every aspect of a WordPress site is customizable through the site editor. For those who have not yet made the leap into full-site editing &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially like the old Customizer but with super powers, better instant previews, and the interface is a panel on the right. At this point, I don&#8217;t think the usability is at a level where someone can just get in there and immediately know what they are doing. It takes a little bit of exploring, but it&#8217;s moving in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Videos like this one show what is possible and just how far WordPress has come since it first introduced the block editor. It also indirectly answers Joost de Valk&#8217;s recent claims that <a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-market-share-shrinking/\">the full-site editing project not being done yet is partially to blame</a> for WordPress&#8217; recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-attributes-declining-market-share-to-performance-issues-increased-complexity-and-the-lagging-full-site-editing-project\">decline in market share</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress remains the uncontested market leader among CMS&#8217;s, some say this small percentage of a decline is inconsequential. Matt Mullenweg has stated in previous interviews that he views market share stats as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities\">trailing indicator</a>&#8221; in the quest to create the best possible experience for users and developers. A growing market share, in that sense, is a signal of user satisfaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress jumped into the block paradigm at the right time, just as many other apps began adopting the concept of composable blocks for creating content and designs. Full-site editing is the extension of that vision but it takes time to make it something polished and delightful to use. McCarthy&#8217;s video is a good reminder of the limitations that users previously labored under while trying to edit their sites, and the &#8220;why&#8221; behind all the effort going into FSE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As someone who&#8217;s currently on the WordPress 6.0 Release Team, I can attest that the project needs more contributors,&#8221; WordPress contributor Nick Diego <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmdiego/status/1524456236518940672\">said</a> in response to the recent market share discussion. &#8220;The fact that FSE has taken so long is not a lack of effort. There are many contributors pouring their hearts and souls into the project. We just need more help.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 May 2022 01:14:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Post Status: Post Status Upgrade — Zen and the Art of Lockpicking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97950\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://poststatus.com/zen-and-the-art-of-lockpicking/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2550:\"<p class=\"has-background\">Learn new skills and build your knowledge to enhance your career in WordPress! <strong>Post Status Upgrade</strong> is an ongoing series of live workshops centered around a particular skill or learning activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Watch Robert Rowley explain the basics of lock picking in this live, hands-on workshop for Post Status members that took place on May 5th, 2022.

The development team intends to publish an upgrade guide to support adoption of custom order tables after migrations have been ironed out.

After hearing oral arguments from both sides, the court has granted SFC&#8217;s motion to remand the case back to California State Court. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808.30.0.pdf\">ruling</a>, US District Court judge Josephine L. Staton stated that the GPL introduces &#8220;an additional contractual promise separate and distinct from any rights provided by the copyright laws:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Court finds Versata’s reasoning persuasive, and it finds here, as the court<br />found there, that the enforcement of “an additional contractual promise separate and distinct from any rights provided by the copyright laws” amounts to an “extra element,” and therefore, SFC’s claims are not preempted. Id. at *5. There is an extra element to SFC’s claims because SFC is asserting, as a third-party beneficiary of the GPL Agreements, that it is entitled to receive source code under the terms of those agreements. There is no right to receive certain works—or source code in particular—under the Copyright Act; indeed, the Act’s primary purpose is to limit who may reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, and display protected works. As SFC points out in its briefing, the right to receive the source code would appear to be “the very opposite” of those exclusive rights. (Reply, Doc. 26, at 17.) The fact that SFC claims status as a third-party beneficiary to the GPL Agreements and not the actual copyright holder—and therefore, has no authority to impose limitations on the reproduction and distribution of the software—only underscores that the contractual right at issue is qualitatively different from the rights under the Copyright Act. Thus, there can be no question that the extra element—that SFC is third-party enforcing its right to receive source code under the terms of a contract—transforms the nature of the action.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the functions of the SFC is to assist member projects in enforcing the terms of FLOSS licenses, including through litigation. This particular case is unique because the organization is presenting this lawsuit on behalf of individual consumers, as opposed to the traditional path of defending copyright holders of the GPL code in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ruling is a watershed moment in the history of copyleft licensing,&#8221; SFC executive director Karen Sandler said. &#8220;This ruling shows that the GPL agreements function both as copyright licenses and as contractual agreements.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SFC  contends that many electronics products are built for planned premature obsolescence and that companies often do this by violating the GPL. If the product is bundled with copyleft software, a consumer has the right to modify, improve, and repair the software. For this the be possible, the companies producing the products must make the source code available. This also enables consumers to find skilled people to repair their products when a device fails after updates have been disabled so that products do not become nonfunctional. This ruling is not just a major win for the GPL but also for consumers who may not know that companies violating the GPL significantly impact their ability to find repairs for electronic products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Software Freedom Conservancy looks forward to our opportunity to prove, in state court, our third-party beneficiary right to the complete, corresponding source code as defined by the GPL and related agreements,” Sandler said. “This claim is central to the right to software repair, as it allows users to exercise the right to copy, share, modify, and reinstall the software on the devices that they receive.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 May 2022 18:03:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: #27 – Ana Segota and Kelly Choyce-Dwan on How To Use the New Pattern Creator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=134337\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/27-ana-segota-and-kelly-choyce-dwan-on-how-to-use-the-new-pattern-creator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48510:\"<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ana_segota\">Ana Segota</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryelle\">Kelly Choyce-Dwan</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect that you might have heard about block patterns, but if you haven’t, you’re in for a treat.

Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you both here. As we always do at the beginning of the podcast, I&#8217;m going to give both of you an opportunity to introduce yourselves, to give us a bit of an orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve listened to the introduction to this podcast, you probably know that we&#8217;re going to be talking about the pattern creator. And so it would be important to know why the two guests today are coming on talking about that. So, we&#8217;ll take it one at a time. We&#8217;ll begin with Ana. Ana, just tell us a little bit about your journey with WordPress and how come it is that you became involved with the pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> So, hi Nathan, nice to meet you and thank you for inviting me. So I&#8217;m Ana Segota, and I am a themer, and I love creating WordPress themes using block patterns. I always was more as a designer, but I learned to code to be able to create WordPress themes myself, but now having a block patterns is such a relief for me because I can concentrate on design more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really nice. Thank you. Yeah. The intention of the tool is to make all of those decisions a little bit easier. So it&#8217;s nice, nice to know that in your case, it&#8217;s working. So, okay that&#8217;s going to be one perspective that we&#8217;ve got in the show today. And another perspective comes from Kelly. So Kelly, just spend a moment, tell us who you are please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Sure. So my name is Kelly Choyce-Dwan, also ryelle online. I work at Automattic and I have for over seven years. I started with WordPress in 2009, and I&#8217;m now working on the Meta team where my focus recently has been on the pattern directory and pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now many people listening to this podcast will be very up-to-date users of WordPress. There&#8217;ll be using the tools that are shipping all of the time, and they may well have discovered patterns and be using them to great effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I suspect that there&#8217;ll be a fair amount of people who as yet have not delved into patterns. They may know what they are. They may not. So I&#8217;m wondering if we could really just rewind a little bit, make no assumptions about anybody&#8217;s knowledge about patterns and just lay out what they are. So it&#8217;s a very general question. Either of you feel free to answer it. What are patterns in WordPress and why might you wish to use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> So for me block patterns, I like predefined and ready to use layout that you can click or drug and create pages. It&#8217;s like a collection of blocks arranged together to help you create different layouts. If you&#8217;ve used sometimes page builders, or Elementor templates, for example, it&#8217;s the same thing. You can use them on your website. You can adjust them, change the layout, change the colors. And I think they&#8217;re very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. So they are basically quick ways to build websites. You&#8217;re using other people&#8217;s predefined layouts. The work, in great measure, has been done for you. You can discover collections of blocks, which are generically called patterns, and you can click on those and import them into your post or page or whatever it might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it speeds things up. I&#8217;m curious, for those of you, who&#8217;ve never used this before again, how do you actually build them? What&#8217;s the process that one might find themselves in, and bear in mind, we might be speaking to users of WordPress who are familiar with page builders, and don&#8217;t really find themselves interacting with the WordPress block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we may need to have a little bit of a description around there. What are we actually doing? How do we create and build patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Okay. so mostly, I&#8217;m building block patterns for the themes. As a background, I first start, with niche, different niche, and what can be useful for that niche. And then I start creating block patterns directly in the editor, where you have all the options of block that you can combine in one block pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly I started with a group block, where I put then columns or cover or images, and start creating different ideas and different layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you able to save those, as WordPress currently stands? Are you able to save those and I&#8217;ll stay with Ana. Are you able to save those Ana so that they can be reused on other websites. In other words, can you save more time by having your own little collection of blocks, which you then can use on this website over here and this other completely different website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:58] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Maybe Kelly knows better, the other way, but what I know you can always copy the block you have and paste it on other website. Or you can export it. But not sure if you can save it inside the editor for like a gallery or something. I&#8217;m not sure that you can, or if you can do this, maybe Kelly knows that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Well, I know that you can, if you copy the block code into like a code file, the you can register it that way, but it requires code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:33] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think, there is no easy way to save it in a gallery for the beginner user, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At the moment, it feels as though it is the domain of people who are fairly experienced with WordPress. All of the tooling, with things like Elementor that you described, where you, you might have a private cloud of things that you&#8217;ve created in the past, and you can log in, and there&#8217;s a cloud service attached and you can download those to all of the other websites. We&#8217;re not quite at that point yet, although maybe some of the discussion that we&#8217;ll have today will revolve around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:10] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, I would love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that would be a really nice addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:14] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> But I think the, pattern creator is doing some kind of saving those block patterns and one place where you can reuse it. But we will come to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ll come to that in a moment. Just to say, patterns are collections of blocks and you piece them together, akin to a jigsaw and you build up designs, and style those designs, add images, add forms, add whatever it might be, background, color, padding, and so on, until you&#8217;ve got something that you&#8217;d like to look off. And at the moment, it probably lives within one WordPress website. But you can copy and paste that over somewhere else, but there&#8217;s no sort of cloud functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, to the main conversation today, which is the pattern creator. Just so that you know, the links will be in the show notes to everything that we talk about today. And the pattern creator may well be something that you want to go and play with because it enables you to do a very large amount more than potentially you can do in your normal WordPress website. So, whoever wishes to take this. What is the pattern creator? Hopefully we&#8217;ll be providing people with the link so they can find that. That&#8217;s all good. But what&#8217;s the purpose of it? Why was it built? Why did the WordPress team decide that a tool like this needed to exist?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So the pattern creator is a place to go and create patterns to share with anyone who uses WordPress, and it was created to make the process of making a sharing patterns easier. It&#8217;s a place that you can go and make a pattern and you know that it can be reused without having to write that code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, at the moment it&#8217;s not only is it a place where you can go and create patterns. It&#8217;s a place where you can go and discover other people&#8217;s already created patterns. And if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re coming to this podcast from another page builder, think about it as rows. You&#8217;re essentially grabbing rows from websites or component parts of websites. And so it serves that double purpose. Not only can you create your own, but you can also go and freely download other people&#8217;s work. Have I got that right? Have I misstated that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> That&#8217;s correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in terms of how the editor works, we need to go to the website, the pattern creator website. And once we&#8217;re there, my understanding is that you need a, a wordpress.org account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got yourself, a wordpress.org account, you can log in and you are presented with something which looks very, very similar to the usual WordPress block editor interface. It&#8217;s a little bit more spartan because the menu on the left kind of basically doesn&#8217;t exist. So all of those options for posts and pages and what have you are gone. Let&#8217;s talk about the design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the menu on the left is gone. We&#8217;ve got the option to add blocks. Are we just dealing with a subset of the core blocks or can we add any of the core blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:15] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> It is a subset currently, because we don&#8217;t have the dynamic content that might be on your website. So we can&#8217;t replicate the full experience of using that block. But almost all of the core blocks are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you can log in and you can start building out your blocks, or rather, I should say you can start building out your patterns. Then presumably there&#8217;s some kind of save process. And if you&#8217;re happy with things, can you use this if you chose to do it this way, can you use this as a private repository of your own blocks, that you&#8217;re maybe not ready to share with the world? Maybe they have to be kept in a draft state or something like that. Could it be used in that way? I know that&#8217;s not the intention. The intention is to have them shareable, but you were to design something and be not entirely satisfied with it, could you keep it there and come back to it at a later date and tweak it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, totally. You can save things as drafts. Actually, when we were first building it out, one of the ideas was that it could be a private repo for you to put your own patterns in. That isn&#8217;t built yet, but it could be in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there is a kind of workaround to make it a directory of your own, if you simply save things as draft. But that isn&#8217;t the point. The intention is to make it universally available to everybody. And so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this require an up to date version of Gutenberg on the backend? So just to be clear, it&#8217;s like a SaaS product. You&#8217;re not installing WordPress anywhere. You are just going to a website and interacting with it. But I&#8217;m just curious to know, as Gutenberg is updated and modified and the blocks change, we&#8217;re several years in, and there&#8217;s been a great deal of change in the way that certain things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have confidence that everything that you build today will look the same in, let&#8217;s say a couple of years time. In other words, do you anticipate that some things may break in the future or are you trying as hard as possible to mitigate against that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Well, I hope it won&#8217;t, but the pattern creator is using always the stable version of Gutenberg. So it will always be up-to-date when you&#8217;re creating patterns. Patterns created a few months ago, we&#8217;re created with an older version of Gutenberg, but between backwards compatibility block transformation, Gutenberg is trying not to break your content too. So I&#8217;m fairly confident that things will continue to work. If there are patterns that do brake, we have a reporting mechanism for reporting that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s just Core blocks that we need to worry about. And it&#8217;s a subset of the Core blocks. Now, I&#8217;m looking on the interface at the moment. There&#8217;s the option for me to add a title? Obviously that&#8217;s just for the purposes of knowing what the pattern is that I&#8217;m saving somewhere. And then I can, in the normal way, click the little plus icon and I can add blocks as I choose. Put a group in, put some columns in and so on, and fiddle with those blocks just as I would do on my regular WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve got the list view where I can see the stack of all of the different things that. I&#8217;ve created. And then on the right-hand side, you&#8217;ve got a title and a description. Do both of those serve the purpose of showing to somebody, once it&#8217;s been submitted to the pattern directory, which we&#8217;ll get onto in just a moment. Those titles and descriptions would give the people, browsing the pattern directory, some orientation as to what it was about and what it was designed to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:46] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s right. The title is the pattern title, and it&#8217;s the same when you&#8217;re in that little sidebar and the top title, they&#8217;re just two inputs for the same thing. Good title would describe what the pattern is, like one of the pattern contains, what it should be used for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Then in order to presumably aid search on the other end in the pattern directory. Currently we have six categories. There&#8217;s no option to create categories of your own. At the minute we look like we&#8217;ve got buttons, columns, gallery, header, images, text, and then there&#8217;s the option to add in keywords, maximum of 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, is this all just to help the taxonomy of it, to help assist people on the other side to locate things which you&#8217;ve got buttons in and specifically columns and galleries and so on? Is that the That&#8217;s the sole purpose of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> That&#8217;s right. And, they&#8217;re also used, those are the same properties that are used in WordPress Core when you&#8217;re registering patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I could spend hours happily building out my new blocks and constructing them up into patterns and saving them away. And once I&#8217;ve got something that I&#8217;m happy with, there&#8217;s a blue submit button at the top right hand corner in the same way that you would have publish in WordPress typically, but this is submit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the process, what&#8217;s going on there? What is the list of things which happen after that? So I&#8217;m thinking in terms of, I just clicked submit, but presumably at that point, all sorts of other things are set in motion. Maybe it&#8217;s sent to a particular team and people have to authorize things and check that it doesn&#8217;t break any guidelines. And that might be a long list of things that go on in the background there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:24] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. So when you submit a pattern, it asks you a few things more just to make sure you filled out all of your details. there are a few things that we&#8217;ll check for automatically, making sure you&#8217;re using a decent title. We&#8217;ve had a few patterns that are just called my pattern, which isn&#8217;t helpful for other people. So we detect things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So after the automated checks, it does get submitted as pending. So it does not automatically approved yet. And there is a pattern review team that will look through the pending patterns and publish things that are valid. Most things do get published. So you probably would get published within a day or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:02] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> It&#8217;s mostly hours or a day. I submitted here, so top, one day</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really quick. A big gripe about the, let&#8217;s say the theme review team or the plugin review team was that there was quite a long wait, sometimes very long. There&#8217;s a lot more complexity, I guess, within a theme, a lot more code floating about. So at the moment. if you submit something, as of, let&#8217;s say May 2022, you&#8217;re very likely to have a decision fairly quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of that being authorized, what are the guidelines? What are the kinds of things that are allowed and disallowed? In other words, so you mentioned that a good title, a good descriptive title is going to set you on the road to having its, authorized and put on the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there any other guidelines that need to be, you need to be mindful of? Not only in terms of getting it submitted, but things that you don&#8217;t want people to submit because it contravenes certain rules or regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think the most important part is to combine multiple blocks together, so not just to use one block and post it. So multiply blocks together and create some interesting and useful layouts. So maybe front design part and also something that can be creative and useful to the users. Also to highlight the capabilities of the blocks they contain and provide a starting point to customize the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good pattern book needs to be, has a well-defined purpose too. And for don&#8217;ts, maybe to avoid to design patterns for a single theme. So to think about it to be used in different websites. Not to create a pattern that is like a full page. Or just a simple pattern that is using a paragraph. And I think you need to use photos from the gallery there. You can&#8217;t import your photos or from some other website, and that&#8217;s probably it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the photos are coming in from, Kelly, maybe you can help us out here. Are they coming in from Openverse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> They are yeah. It&#8217;s all CC0 photos from Openverse. So they&#8217;re able to be used by anyone without any, without worry about crediting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Another podcast episode altogether isn&#8217;t it? The whole Openverse project&#8217;s fabulous. Yeah. so obviously there&#8217;s constraints in terms of the do&#8217;s, you know, it needs to be usable on multiple websites, and so on, just as Ana said, but there&#8217;s some certain don&#8217;ts as well. We&#8217;ve prevented the ability to upload images by just using Openverse images, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I guess that would be in terms of the text that you write into paragraph or heading fields, there would be a requirement for it to be, let&#8217;s call it family friendly. You know, we don&#8217;t want anything which might cause anybody any hassle and presumably that&#8217;s a trip wire which the team would immediately reject it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, okay. Let&#8217;s let&#8217;s imagine that we&#8217;ve built this fabulous pattern. It&#8217;s absolutely hit the guidance on the head and it&#8217;s been approved. What then? Where does it go? Where does it live? How can other people find it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:24] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So it&#8217;s in the pattern directory, which is just wordpress.org/patterns. You can use that website to search through patterns. Once you found a pattern that you like, you&#8217;re able to use it in your own website, just by simply copying it. And there is a copy button on each pattern that you can use to copy the code for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you just paste that straight into your editor, you have that pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, you go to the pattern directory, presumably you would then search and filter against the things which you created when you were submitting your pattern. And then there&#8217;s a simple copy and paste button. You copy it. It&#8217;s in the clipboard of your computer and you just go over to your website and in an empty block, there&#8217;s no sort of container or wrapper that you need to stick it in. You literally just paste it into a brand new empty text block and all will work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there any gotchas there? Because that process, whilst it&#8217;s not necessarily quite as optimal as the cloud that we were talking about earlier, where you could actually see it within your WordPress website, which I guess ultimately would be an easier experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it always work? Are there any situations where copying and pasting that code has unexpected consequences. I don&#8217;t mean things breaking. I just mean that the styling, for example, something that the theme brings to bear might make things look peculiar and not quite how you intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:51] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s possible because it is, I mean it uses the Core blocks. So if your theme styles the core blocks minimally, maybe, you&#8217;ll probably be fine, but if your theme is doing anything really creative with some of the blocks, I suppose you could have some trouble where a quote that you copied from the pattern directory looks totally different on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> But if you are using a full site editing theme, I think you are good with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It should just work. Yeah. Do you know if there&#8217;s any intention to bring any of this kind of functionality into WordPress Core. And what I&#8217;m meaning by that is that I could hook up my let&#8217;s say wordpress.org account to my website. And then I could create patterns inside my website and then authorize them to be submitted to the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like that might be quite a useful workflow at some point in the future, because then you&#8217;re not necessarily having to go out and go to a different website in order to create the patterns and publish them and so on. And equally, I wonder if in the future there are any plans to make it so that I can pull these patterns in, in the same way that we described that page builders like Elementor and so on, have their cloud templates and so on, and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I think the second is much more likely than the first. So if you were to create a pattern on your own website. Uh, you might be using any number of blocks that are not Core blocks. So I don&#8217;t know that creating a pattern on your website and pushing it up is on the roadmap at least, because there&#8217;s a lot more gotchas. We can&#8217;t control the media that you&#8217;re using. Like we&#8217;re able to use Open verse images on the pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot more, a lot more like gotchas that way. But, having an ability to pull patterns from the pattern directory on wordpress.org into your own site. I do think that that is probably going to happen soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, you can call out, well already in WordPress 6.0, you&#8217;ll be able to register pattern slugs when you&#8217;re building a theme, and then it will pull down those patterns from the pattern directory. So you can pull patterns like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s interesting. So imagine that I&#8217;ve submitted one of my patterns. I&#8217;m very happy with it, but a year or two passes and I now for goodness knows what reason, I now don&#8217;t wish that pattern to be part of the directory. I&#8217;m wondering if either of you have any knowledge about whether things can be removed or once I&#8217;ve submitted it, is it up there for life? And I have essentially given it over to the community in perpetuity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:36] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> You can revert your pattern to draft, if you want to take it down. You can also trash it. We&#8217;re not tied to always supporting things the way that the theme and plugin directories are because there isn&#8217;t really as much of a tie to your content and this thing on wordpress.org, because once you copy a pattern down, you have it, you don&#8217;t need to sync back up with the parent. So we don&#8217;t need to, we don&#8217;t have the same issues of keeping something around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so you can curate that yourself. You can just, if you like return it to a draft status. So there&#8217;s a permanent connection between the wordpress.org repository that I can access with my user login and password, and the pattern being published. In other words, when I clicked submit, it&#8217;s not just taken from my submission and put into some other SaaS, if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my expectation was that when I submitted it, much in the same way that I was submitting a form on a website, that form can then live somewhere else. You know, the form submission can come to me via email. I can&#8217;t rescind that form being sent. But in the directory the submit button and the draft status button is directly connected to whether it&#8217;s on the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I click draft again, it will immediately, without any human supervision, it will suck it out of the directory and mean that it&#8217;s no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, that that&#8217;s correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I really didn&#8217;t understand that. I just assumed that I was submitting it rather like a form. Somebody would inspect it, check it into another platform. So that&#8217;s kind of good to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:15] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. It also means that you can edit. So if you make your pattern and then you decide that you actually, you&#8217;ve submitted it, it&#8217;s been a week though. And you don&#8217;t like the color of the button. You can make that change. It&#8217;ll submit it back to pending, and it has to go through that review again. But, once it&#8217;s published, your pattern will have the new change now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So we have to go through the process. Do you have any insight into how popular patterns have become over time? I mean, I still feel that the editing experience for proprietary page builders is something that people are keen for Gutenberg to have. You know, in other words, what you see is literally what you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no ifs or buts, it&#8217;s just exactly the same on the backend as it is on the front end. And I feel that a lot of people are not moving over to Gutenberg because that experience is not there yet. So, this one may be for Kelly, it may be for Ana. Ana, you might like to draw on, you know, your experience or maybe your friends and colleagues. Is it as usable yet? Are patterns as useful to you as your page builder that you may have used in the past yet? Or if we still got a way to go, what are your, what are your instincts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:25] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> From my point of view, I think the block patterns are now really well made and they can be really useful. And I think they are mostly easier to use them. So for the user&#8217;s point of view, but they come more to the problem where we are starting to use templates, for example. Full site editing and templates. Block patterns are I think easiest part from the whole full site editing,.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience, mostly they like block patterns but, I think we are still in early stage because there is not a lot of themes that are full site editing themes. And sometimes we also have older themes that we are updating with block patterns, but it&#8217;s like a mix of old way and new way. So I think when we start doing more full site editing themes, it will get easier and user will get to know znd to accept it more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think block patterns are really useful from the user side, but templates are a bit tricky now, I must say, a bit confusing because we have a two editors now, like site editor and normal editor that they know from past. And they&#8217;re asking why I see now here block pattern, but in the old editor I need to click on the edit template to edit the template. It&#8217;s a bit tricky and confusing at the moment I must confess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re on the cusp of WordPress 6.0 being released, and as each different, a new release comes around, there is more being added and the complexity sometimes goes up and hopefully at some point the complexity will go down again and be more straightforward to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that one of the biggest wins of using patterns and the pattern directory, which you would submit things to with the creator, is that all of this is just free. It&#8217;s completely freely available. You can use it in any which way you&#8217;d like, there&#8217;s no constraints over how you might use it. And if we rewind the clock about, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s go for about 12 or 13 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine that the plug-in directory felt like a similar thing, you know, you would submit your plugin and within a few hours, somebody would say yes. That&#8217;s great, thank you very much. We now know that WordPress has 50,000 plus plugins. The directory whilst being very useful is quite hard, it&#8217;s very difficult to track things down. We&#8217;ve got certain things being recommended because they&#8217;re popular and it may be hard for people to have their bits and pieces discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just wondering, Kelly I&#8217;ll fire this one at you. I&#8217;m just wondering if in the future there are plans to make it so that as you submit patterns, there&#8217;s maybe more options around curating it, more taxonomy, terms, greater ways of being able to search and discover things. Because at the moment, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a handful of patterns, well, that&#8217;s not quite true, but you get point. There aren&#8217;t 50,000 of them. But in the future, when this takes off, I could see there being literally hundreds of thousands of patterns. And at that point it&#8217;s going to be extremely difficult to separate the ones that you would like from the ones which are just there in front of you, but you don&#8217;t necessarily feel able to use. So really I&#8217;m just wondering how that may be curated in the future. Any roadmap plans for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. you&#8217;re right there are, what did you say, 50,000 plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:04] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s 400 patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:07] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So a little different. I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s any concrete roadmap for what the future of this directory might look like. There are some discussions about whether there should be different categories, like buttons, columns, taxonomy. There&#8217;s questions about how we should handle patterns that are more for site building versus just content patterns. So I do think that this is all very much still like to be decided, and really if anyone has opinions, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll get onto that actually now because that feels like a good point. So obviously this is being built out in the open. The pair of you have obviously taken a great interest in it, but it may be that people listening to this, this is new to them. And they think that they would like to play with this a little bit, become involved with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe again, I&#8217;ll direct this one at Kelly first off. Are there any ways, better ways where people can get involved in the project of the directory or the creator? Where are the best places to go and hang out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:12] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> If you want to have feedback about the future of the pattern directory or if you just want to report that something&#8217;s not working. The project is on GitHub. It&#8217;s at github.com/wordpress/patterndirectory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s the best place to go if you wish to find out about becoming involved. Ana, just wondering about your experiences of being involved with this. Have you got any, any insights? Is there a thing that you found the most useful? A, I don&#8217;t know, a Slack channel or a website where people are helping each other out. A group of some kind, maybe a community online somewhere where this is all happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:50] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I was in contact per Slack, with Anne McCartney also and, mostly Slack and Twitter, but yeah, mostly Slack or Github, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now, I know that neither of you will be able to answer this question directly, but the theme repository and the plugin repository, they feel like there&#8217;s no way that they are going away. They&#8217;re going to be here for the long-term. You know, I can imagine decades from now, they&#8217;ll still be in existence. Do you both have confidence that this journey that we&#8217;ve taken on where blocks and patterns are becoming the new, the new way of creating quick and easy websites. Do you feel confident that this is the way it&#8217;s going to be done? You know, that we ought to sail our ship in this direction?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your long-term thoughts really on whether or not this is the way it&#8217;s going to be done in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:40] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I hope so. I really hope so. I think this way is, better way of making, for example, I am in theme business, so, it&#8217;s easier to create themes. Especially to offer easier way of using themes to users. So finally theme can be a design for me, and that&#8217;s a really big step in the right direction. So I really hope it will stay. And also be better with the time and more easier to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. And Kelly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I do think that this is the way forward. I think that using blocks and making patterns is really only going to become more, more standard. Easier to use. And so I think that this is going to be the way to make websites</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Just one last quick thought. I mentioned something similar earlier and Ana talked about it, I&#8217;m going to direct this one at you, Kelly, if that&#8217;s all right. I don&#8217;t know what your experience is with other website building tools. And we mentioned page builders, such as Elementor and, I just wondered what your thoughts are on where the user interface is and the user experience is at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve got some insight into that. Maybe you don&#8217;t, but I just wondered whether you thought that it was yet at a point of maturity. And that kind of ties into the question I&#8217;ve just asked about whether it would be widely adopted, because it feels like there&#8217;s a big holdout of people the moment who simply cannot make the move because the experience as yet doesn&#8217;t have that, it&#8217;s exactly the same on the front end, as it is on the backend. And Ana, I think you just said, Yeah in the background. You can identify. You&#8217;ve committed, you&#8217;ve jumped over and you&#8217;ve made that journey and put the investment of time into&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, but it takes a lot of challenges, yeah. Because I get the input from the user side and I also used Elementor before to see how it works. And I must say it&#8217;s still a long way. But, what is most confusing now to the users, what I said before, also, those two editors and two different phase. We now have again templates that you can edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re a bit confused. Like, okay, I go on out to edit the template and I saved it and now it&#8217;s applied to all my pages and now you need to explain it that they need to refresh it and pull it back. And it&#8217;s a bit confusing. So we don&#8217;t have one editor where you can do all the things. For example, you come to one editor and click, for example, to choose a layout and this layout is there and you can edit it and that&#8217;s it. Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit struggle for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do wonder if that struggle, and I&#8217;m going to see what Kelly makes on this, I do wonder if that&#8217;s going to be for a little while into the future, if that&#8217;s going to be a limitation in terms of adoption, is the fact that there are difficulties. There&#8217;s a lot of learning which needs to take place to wean you off those tools and, whilst the WordPress Core way of doing blocks and patterns and so on is free, widely available, done in the open, open source and all of that kind of stuff. I wonder if the adoption is going to be stifled because of the constraints that Ana just mentioned. What do you think about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:04] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think it depends also on us, on themers a lot. How we will implement this and make it easier for the users. And we also need to educate now the users, how they can use it and make it as easier as possible. And sometimes there&#8217;s not that easy because you need to follow updates and to do the updates all the time and to educate people about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s a good step in the right direction. And I think with the time and with the education people will adopted it yeah. Just by creating a pages using just block pattern it&#8217;s a really a big step. And it&#8217;s a great thing. You can really create most everything with block patterns without using templates for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think people just need time, the inspiration to get into it&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:59] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> It&#8217;s a new, it&#8217;s a new thing and you always need time to learn something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. We actually interviewed Courtney Robertson from the Learn initiative last week. And there&#8217;s an awful lot of content. And I think that&#8217;s maybe a piece that was missing in the past, the ability to go and find video tutorials, which answer the exact question that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly, can I put that one to you? Is it basically the same question? You said that you hadn&#8217;t got a great deal of experience with page builders and so on, but I&#8217;m just wondering if you had any intuitions around there, whether or not the UI and the UX is, is everything that you guys had hoped it would be, or do you feel that there&#8217;s still quite a lot of work going through WordPress six and seven and maybe even, eight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:39] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I haven&#8217;t used page filters. I am definitely a pretty vanilla WordPress user. But I have been, you know, working with the site editor and I can see that it is a little confusing still. I do think that it needs to be iterated on, but I think that the future is going to be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the plans are there and it&#8217;s constantly getting better. So I&#8217;m very positive about it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Okay, just to wrap up, if people have listened to this podcast today and they would like to get in touch with you and make contact and use your expertise. What&#8217;s the best way of getting in touch with you? It could be a Twitter handle could be an email address, or it could be nothing. You might wish to share nothing at all, but I&#8217;ll start with Ana. What&#8217;s the best way to get in touch with you, Ana?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Twitter, or Slack or email. It&#8217;s all good. Maybe you can add a later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I will definitely add your Twitter and Slack into the show notes. And same question to you, Kelly. What&#8217;s the best way to get in touch with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:40] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> You can find me on Twitter, Ryelle, R Y E L L E or on wordpress.org Slack. I can also chat there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, Ana and Kelly, thank you so much for talking to me on the podcast today, and I appreciate you giving me an hour of your time. Thank you very much, indeed.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 May 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: WooCommerce 6.5, 6.5.1, and WooCommerce Blocks 7.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97704\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-6-5-6-5-1-and-woocommerce-blocks-7-6/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3050:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Well, the week started the release of  <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/05/10/woocommerce-6-5-released/\"><strong>WooCommerce 6.5</strong></a>  and ended with a  <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/05/13/woocommerce-6-5-1-fix-release/\"><strong>6.5.1 bug fix</strong></a> release.

Sometimes this comes with a cost. It’s no secret that WordPress has a bad reputation when it comes to development. It has a lot of legacy baggage and die-hard rules that prevent any backward compatibility breaking change when it comes to PHP code (Gutenberg is another story I won’t get into).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That legacy PHP code is often used by the developers that are starting to enter the world of programming, and the issue with that is they can learn some bad programming patterns. That in turn means they will reuse the poorly written code, increasing the amount of bad code in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where WordPress gets its bad reputation in the developer community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Breaking the cycle</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can we break this cycle of bad code? By teaching new developers how they should write good code. One example of teaching new developers (but also old ones that are still clinging to the ‘WordPress’ way of doing things) is by writing tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way is to encourage them to use tools that can help them write better code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m currently involved in the work which aims to release the new version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>, a set of rules used for the <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> tool that will let you know if your code has some potential issues (security, best practices, code style).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tool that I’ve recently developed is a <a href=\"https://github.com/dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup\">package</a> that will help developers set up WordPress integration tests that use the <a href=\"https://pestphp.com\">Pest</a> testing framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ok, so why do we need this new tool?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The main motivation behind creating this package is to encourage more people to write tests for their code, especially plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of developers in the WordPress community go with the mantra: I can see that it works because I’ve tried it out in my browser. That’s OK, but there are issues with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it’s time-consuming. Every time you make some change, you need to make sure it works, but also that you didn’t break anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, people make mistakes. We are not foolproof, and code may be misused in ways you never thought possible. You would be amazed at how creative people can be when writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated tests are quick and can help you in testing various cases that will happen when you execute your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You test for the intended behavior (happy path), and in a quick way, you can add examples of how your code can be used in a way you didn’t intend it to be used (unhappy path).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also safeguards your code from regressions. A code regression is when you unintentionally break one part of your code by adding new code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The problem with tests set up so far</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing in WordPress is not a new thing. And it’s not like you couldn’t set up tests for your code before. There are amazing libraries out there that will help you set everything up like <a href=\"https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/\">wp-browser</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the problem is that the setup procedure is often clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to set up a separate database for tests, and you need to run certain scripts, then change files to make it all work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, it’s not a straightforward thing to do, and developers are by nature lazy creatures (that’s why we write code to do things for us <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png\" alt=\"😄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of the wp-pest integration test setup is to eliminate all that extra work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to set it up</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to set it up, your project must use <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a>. It’s a de-facto standard way of adding packages to your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your terminal type</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>composer require dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup --dev</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After you’ve downloaded the package and its dependencies you can set up the theme tests by typing</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/wp-pest setup theme</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in the case you want to set up tests for your plugin, you can write</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/wp-pest setup plugin --plugin-slug=your-plugin-slug</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Optionally, you can provide a <code>--wp-version</code> parameter, to specify which WordPress version you&#8217;d like to test your code on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the background, a WordPress instance will be downloaded, and an in-memory database will be set up, along with two examples of tests that you can run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, running either</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/pest --group=unit</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/pest --group=integration</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>will run the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of Pest is that its syntax is developer-friendly. It has <a href=\"https://pestphp.com/docs/installation\">amazing documentation</a> and great syntax. Let’s look at a simple example. Say you are registering a custom post type called &#8216;Books&#8217;:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\n/**\n * Plugin Name: Test plugin\n * Desctiption: Test plugin\n * Version: 1.0.0\n * License: MIT\n */\n\nfunction test_plugin_register_books_cpt() {\n    $args = array(\n        \'label\'              =&gt; esc_html__( \'Books\', \'test-plugin\' ),\n        \'public\'             =&gt; true,\n        \'publicly_queryable\' =&gt; true,\n        \'show_ui\'            =&gt; true,\n        \'show_in_menu\'       =&gt; true,\n        \'query_var\'          =&gt; true,\n        \'rewrite\'            =&gt; array( \'slug\' =&gt; \'book\' ),\n        \'capability_type\'    =&gt; \'post\',\n        \'has_archive\'        =&gt; true,\n        \'hierarchical\'       =&gt; false,\n        \'menu_position\'      =&gt; null,\n        \'supports\'           =&gt; array( \'title\', \'editor\', \'author\', \'thumbnail\', \'excerpt\', \'comments\' ),\n    );\n \n    register_post_type( \'book\', $args );\n}\n \nadd_action( \'init\', \'test_plugin_register_books_cpt\' );\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running the setup command that adds an example, a test called <code>BooksCptTest.php</code> would look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\nnamespace Tests\\Integration;\n\nbeforeEach(function () {\n	parent::setUp();\n});\n\nafterEach(function () {\n	parent::tearDown();\n});\n\ntest(\'Books custom post type is registered\', function () {\n	// We can use assertions from PHP_Unit.\n	$this-&gt;assertNotFalse(has_action(\'init\', \'test_plugin_register_books_cpt\'));\n\n	$registeredPostTypes = \\get_post_types();\n\n	// Or we can use expectations API from Pest.\n	expect($registeredPostTypes)\n		-&gt;toBeArray()\n		-&gt;toHaveKey(\'book\');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Running <code>vendor/bin/pest --group=integration</code> gives us the following output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Installing...\nRunning as single site... To run multisite, use -c tests/phpunit/multisite.xml\nNot running ajax tests. To execute these, use --group ajax.\nNot running ms-files tests. To execute these, use --group ms-files.\nNot running external-http tests.

Tests are amazing because not only are they safeguarding us from mistakes, but they also force us to write clean and testable code.

Co-organizer Victor Ramirez will kick it off with a workshop titled &#8220;The Product &amp; Marketing Data Landscape.&#8221; Attendees will get an overview of  the current WordPress analytics landscape.

The county sits at the southernmost point of state, with a declining population of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/mcdowellcountywestvirginia\">18,363</a> and a median household income of $27,682. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1950&#8217;s, at the apex of the mining industry&#8217;s economic influence, McDowell County had close to 100,000 people living there. They mined the coal that built much of the infrastructure for American cities. After the industry became more mechanized and many left to find work elsewhere, the community began to deteriorate, drugs got a foothold, and many local kids are now raised by their grandparents. Property taxes evaporated, as a large number of homes are on homestead exemption, which further lowers property taxes for those who are 65+ or considered disabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News remains in the county as a unifying force that the dwindling populace relies on to stay connected and informed. Publisher Melissa Nester often says she learned how to read by reading the Welch News. Three years ago, she purchased her local newspaper to keep it from shuttering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our previous owner made the decision to close the newspaper at a point we felt we were going strong,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;Revenue had declined along with the business population we used to support our operation over the years, however we felt it was an asset to community building and wanted to use it as such.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The Welch News Publisher Melissa Nestor &#8211; photo credit: The Welch News\n\n\n\n<p>Nester purchased the paper, with the promised support of her core team members at the time. Most of them are still working with her today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Welch News had been a staple in all our lives,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;When we announced that we would cease to print, the community was outraged. We cried with customers stopping in to see us one last time, most of them sharing stories of their first job being a paper carrier at the newspaper. One of our carriers at the time told us the story of an elderly woman who said all she had at home was a landline phone and The Welch News. It’s all she had. We were absolutely floored as we heard how much our community wanted us to remain.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Welch News Launches a Digital Publication on WordPress with the Help of the PaywallProject</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />photo credit &#8211; The PaywallProject\n\n\n\n<p>After purchasing the paper, Nester held a meeting on May 8, 2018, where she invited everyone she could think of to help her plan a path to move forward. Tyler Channell, creator of the <a href=\"https://www.paywallproject.com/\">PaywallProject</a>, attended this meeting and listened to the team&#8217;s goals and concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Building simple WordPress-based sites for various businesses is something I&#8217;ve done dating back to 2008,&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;I really started focusing on local newspaper web development in late 2017 after graduate school (journalism) at West Virginia University.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channell began helping local West Virginian newspapers, after they reached out with specific questions about generating revenue from their publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Digital ads weren&#8217;t cutting it for them (a similar story I hear from publishers across the country),&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;With Facebook and Google owning virtually the entire digital ad market, newspapers must focus their efforts on generating paid digital subscriptions to remain sustainable. People are willing to pay for local content that they can&#8217;t get anywhere else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After helping his first local newspaper find success with a paywall he implemented, he decided to put together a simple ready-to-go website solution focused on growing paid digital subscribers for local newspapers across West Virginia and beyond. He now has approximately 20 local newspapers signed on to the PaywallProject&#8217;s services. The all-in-one subscription platform for local news costs $199/month and includes website development, a flexible paywall subscription platform with no transaction fees, migration, and built-in ad management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I use a number of different themes/plugin-based solutions combined with custom code, payments via Stripe, and hosting through DigitalOcean to bring it all together,&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;The goal for me is to provide all technical aspects so that local news publishers can focus on publishing content.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many small publishers, this is their very first website. Channell said his clients are quick to acclimate to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think when you remove the technical aspects of digital subscriptions, it reduces the learning curve dramatically,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Growing digital subscriptions takes a lot of time and effort. But with each new paid subscriber a newspaper brings on board, local journalism becomes that much more sustainable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News&#8217; WordPress site helped put the publication on a path to sustainability. Within the first ten days of launching their digital edition, they gained 100 new subscribers, and subscriptions keep rolling in from local residents and people all over the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe [Channell] was particularly interested when he learned our newsroom was staffed by millennials who cared deeply about the community they live in and hoped to make a positive change,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;He realized our staff could easily transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As publisher/owner, at 56 years old, I have probably been the person hardest to train on using the site, but even I am very comfortable posting articles without help.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welch News Editor Derek Tyson is the primary person writing and editing articles, approving submissions, and managing ad design and layout for the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We really enjoy the ease of access WordPress offers,&#8221; Tyson said. &#8220;I think we all were quite surprised how easy it was to put our articles into the digital format to share with the world at large. The transition wasn’t hard. Changing our office routine after over 90 years of only print publishing was by far the hardest part.  PaywallProject made this transition easy for us.  Trainings happened in our own newsroom, and PaywallProject has always available to help with any issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The Welch News Editor Derek Tyson &#8211; photo credit: The Welch News\n\n\n\n<p>The entire publication process is still very much a labor of love, as is evident in this video the PaywallProject created featuring The Welch News. The team managing it is far younger than most of the town but fiercely dedicated to keeping this vital community resource going.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Growing paid digital subscriptions in rural Appalachia is possible! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nestergirl2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nestergirl2</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thatdamntyson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@thatdamntyson</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rpOE8fUEqM\">pic.twitter.com/rpOE8fUEqM</a></p>&mdash; PaywallProject (@paywallproject) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paywallproject/status/1523755491683631104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>“Putting ourselves out into the digital world was both exciting and terrifying,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;We were skeptical about our content being capable of generating online subscriptions. But it was the best case of being proven wrong in our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It does sometimes feel unnerving to move from a local publication that is only read via print media in your community, to a publication with a far greater reach.  Sometimes that brings forth &#8216;internet warriors&#8217; to criticize, as well as &#8216;internet warriors&#8217; to support.  PaywallProject is knowledgeable in the field of journalism, and that makes a great difference.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Welch News Still Prints and Delivers the Paper Three Days Per Week</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News is just one of hundreds of publications that have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-wordpress-in-the-post-print-news-era\">found WordPress in the post-print news era</a>, but unlike many others who transitioned to purely digital publishing, they are committed to keeping their print version going on their 1966 model printing press. They print three days a week and offer home delivery within McDowell County, as well as mail delivery across the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have a high population of elderly residents, and strongly feel that they need the connection with the home delivery drivers three times each week,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;We understand this isn’t the greatest business model, and often hear the advice to move to a weekly publication. Our desire to serve our residents in the best way possible keeps us headstrong about a three-day print publication.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though nearly everyone from his generation has moved away from the area, Tyson&#8217;s commitment to serve The Welch News&#8217; elderly subscribers burns strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to serve a very vulnerable population that I feel like the modern world is pretty quick to sweep under the rug,&#8221; Tyson said in a recent <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/495924832/492e92a96f\">documentary</a> about the county. &#8220;I see elderly people suffer, feeling like they&#8217;re not important and nobody needs them anymore. That&#8217;s just awful. They&#8217;re not as strong, they move a little slow, they&#8217;ll talk your head off but they&#8217;re living human beings that matter, and I&#8217;m going to fight for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local news stands as a guardian for small, economically vulnerable counties like McDowell. In an area that is frequently cited among the five poorest counties in the US, the people still have their own voice through The Welch News. This publication finding sustainability is like a flower growing up through the concrete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we witness the slow death of the American newspaper, these little newspapers staying alive to keep the public informed offer a ray of hope. Small publications continue to contend with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/more-than-200-local-newspaper-publishers-are-suing-google-and-facebook-for-damages\">the greed and corruption of the advertising industry</a>, tech giants that have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">willfully eroded publishers&#8217; trust </a>through collusion and manipulation of the digital ad market. With affordable publishing tools like WordPress, The Welch News and its contemporaries can have a fighting chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is very much a heart project to serve and better our community, and we aren&#8217;t sure how long we can sustain it,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;I&#8217;m certain we wouldn&#8217;t have survived the income loss from COVID without our website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I often say I quit my job every morning, but go anyway. I quit again by nightfall, and the email comes showing the income from online subscriptions and I decide to try again.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson and his small team of journalists believe the best hope for keeping local news alive, when many small outlets have shuttered or consolidated, is maintaing a hyperlocal focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our strategy has been to shift our content priorities from broad coverage to a hyperlocal focus on issues within McDowell County’s borders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With so many forms of media coverage available today, we decided to focus on what you couldn’t find anywhere else and in turn, showing that important things happen in small towns that deserve media attention.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress and the PaywallProject helped introduce a new stream of revenue for their century-old business. As the subscriptions continued to flow in, Nester said they realized &#8220;hyperlocal content did indeed have true value and would not be found anywhere else.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the reasons <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2022/the-pulitzers-still-value-opinion-writing-and-so-do-readers/\">many of the 2022 Pulizter prize winners have won for local stories</a> that would never be covered in the larger news market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Citizens near and far should understand the need to fund local newsrooms, and the important work they do,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;Understanding that without supporting local journalists, a large sense of community will be lost with each news desert that comes.  If newsrooms are funded through community support, it is a better representation of that community and a means to bring forward local issues for resolution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 May 2022 15:16:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 31: Open Source &amp; Accessibility– Celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day With Guest Joe Devon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/episode-31-open-source-accessibility-celebrating-global-accessibility-awareness-day-with-guest-joe-devon/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33186:\"<p>In the thirty-first episode of the WordPress Briefing, GAAD Co-Founder Joe Devon joins WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy to discuss Global Accessibility Awareness Day and the role of open source in accessibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 May 2022 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 13:31:58 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 13:15:09 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','no');

This is the story of the last decade, told by those who built it.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d67c653ac3\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>In the world of horology, the official title of Watchmaker is reverently reserved for a skilled few. After the last ten years of honing his craft in Detroit, Shinola Watchmaker Stefan Mihoc is ready for many more to come. To him, it’s been a decade of living the dream. And it doesn’t show any signs of stopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ten years ago in Detroit, a spark was ignited and quickly transformed into a lightning bolt,” he explains, harkening to the signature Shinola bolt that stands as a symbol of quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the next ten years, the world will hear a thunder.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started when a watch factory was installed in 30,000 empty square feet in the historic Argonaut Building. Ten years later, the timekeepers of Detroit have assembled over one million watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mihoc is just one of many original employees from the early days of Shinola who remain firmly rooted in the mission today.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/01-Stefan.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=751&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5488\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d682b53ac4\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:#f9f7f4\">\n    \n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div style=\"height:65px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lakishka McCoy, Titus Hayes, Taneisha Brown, Salah Altam, and Tae’Aunna Schumake have all had a part in building this legacy, piece by piece. Literally. They’re five of the first watch assemblers of Detroit. Now, they’re mentoring and leading the next generation—and reflecting on the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the sight of a well-loved, slightly faded New York Times advertisement, Tae’Aunna Schumake’s face lights up with recognition. It announces the original Runwell. “This brings back memories of when I first started,” she explains. Schumake’s journey with Shinola started at the dial application station of the watch assembly line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were just beginning to assemble the first watches. Seeing this, it makes me proud. The Runwell was the first. And the Runwell runs well!” She laughs.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div style=\"height:72px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1030\" height=\"1878\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-24-at-7.24.59-PM.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=1080&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1920&amp;wpsize=article\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5495\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:26px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/03-Laughing-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=682&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5553\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68a553ac5\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Lakishka McCoy, another original assembler, grew into a team leadership role and is now a movement and clock department supervisor. “As the years pass, I fall more and more in love with the job and the company. And that’s why I’ve stayed so long.” McCoy’s journey started with an immersive and intense training under Ronda AG, a Swiss manufacturer with decades of heritage of their own. Now, she’s one of the watchful experts that oversees assembly. Looking back, she muses, “I’ve grown in a lot of ways.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would she describe the Shinola of the future? “Still shining,” she says, with a sparkle all her own.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68b053ac6\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:#f9f7f4\">\n    \n\n<div style=\"height:68px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After nine years with Shinola, Salah Altam agrees. Altam has progressed through nearly every element of the craft of watches. Starting with the hands, he moved to case back closing, and finally to the finely tuned world of repairs. Altam sees no signs of slowing down. “Every year, Shinola has grown up. We will have more watches, more projects, and continue to be great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s seconded by Taneisha Brown, an original assembler who moved into a position as a movement repair tech after a supervisor noticed her affinity for the ultra-delicate world of watch movements. “If I had one word to describe the future for Shinola, it would be indescribable,” she laughs joyfully. “Because I never know what we’re going to do next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=755&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5555\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68d853ac7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>“When I started, there was only seven or eight people hanging lights, a couple of desks, and an empty factory floor,” says Titus Hayes. Like Brown, his first role at Shinola was in movement assembly. In the last decade, he’s stepped into more and more responsibility, making his way up in his technical skills to repairs. He now oversees assembly as a production manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To see it grow, I feel I was a part of that. That’s why I stayed the last ten years. Because I wanted to be a part of something great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that after a decade in the making, it’s the people who make that greatness a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time-tested confidence, the original Runwell line will train the next generation of Shinola watch artisans, designers, and creatives. And they’ll train the next wave after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the next wave after that.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"809\" height=\"793\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5556\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/the-timekeepers-of-detroit/\">The Timekeepers of Detroit</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','The Timekeepers of Detroit','With ten years and over one million watches in the books, the long history of Detroit watchmaking is well underway.

The time displayed there, counted from midnight, is Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT. Every time zone in the world is plus or minus an hour from this baseline “zero.” Pilots call it “Zulu Time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the days of WWII, air force pilots and other military navigators carried 24-hour “G.C.T.” pocket watches set to Greenwich Central Time, as it was known then.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>But it wasn’t until the rise of intercontinental air travel that a need arose to track a local and universal time zone at once. If you’re a pilot taking off from New York and landing in Paris, you’d like to know the local time and the destination time with just a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the early 1950’s, the GMT was born: A travel watch that combines three-hand local time with an arrow-tipped GMT hand that rotates once a day, read with a 24-hour bezel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed specifically for pilots, early GMT watches prioritized high readability for quick decision making, extreme lume for dimly lit cockpits, and absolute precision for an ultra-demanding job.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"392\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/01-GCT-Pocketwatch.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=353&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=696&amp;wpsize=home-cat-short\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5417\" /><figcaption><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">An early &#8220;G.C.T.&#8221; pocket watch.</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62853eb8a0b13\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Even in today’s age of tech, GMT watches continue to provide an elegant solution for pilots, captains, travelers, and anyone with a loved one in another time zones.

The Shinola Monster GMT Automatic is part of the long-successful Monster Automatic Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">First introduced in 2017 as Shinola’s flagship automatic, the Lake Eerie Monster eventually grew into a series of Great Lakes inspired dive watches, rated at 30 ATM and testing beyond international standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Five years later, the platform takes its first step into the GMT zone, expanding what it means to be a Monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">“This is really an example of us collecting feedback from our audience, and proving that we’re listening, we hear you,” explains Director of Watch Design Greg V. “There was a strong desire for a smaller case size and an open case back window, so we found a way to do that with the Monster series in the form of a GMT travel watch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Unlike its predecessors, the GMT is a lighter-on-the-wrist travel automatic with a full exhibition case back that reveals the rotor and inner workings. The GMT boasts a 10 ATM rating and arrives with an additional woven strap. Made from upcycled #tide® ocean bound plastic, it’s breathable, waterproof, and eco-conscious. Just save the truly deep end for a Monster dive watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:63px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1074\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/03-Image-1-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=679&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5477\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1074\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Image-2-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=679&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5478\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62853f4ca0b15\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">But the Monster GMT embodies—and continues—the Shinola Monster spirit with its technical acumen and precision craftsmanship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">A Swiss-made Sellita SW330-2 movement inside has twenty-five jewels for reducing friction and holds a 56-hour power reserve. Through the power of physics and mechanical engineering, the rotor moves with its wearer, keeping the automatic movement wound. Watch it at work through the exhibition window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Early GMT models had a fixed bezel, but with the Monster GMT’s rotating 24-hour bezel, you can track another time zone with a little addition and subtraction. The bezel, crafted with ceramic, is fine-tuned in assembly and rigorously quality-checked at the Shinola watch factory in Detroit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">This four-handed GMT automatic arrives just shy of the factory’s ten-year anniversary. It’s a testament to past growth, from watch design to the assembly line. And it’s a glimpse of the future, taking flight.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/arrivals-and-departures-monster-gmt/\">Arrivals and Departures at the Greenwich Meridian</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Arrivals and Departures at the Greenwich Meridian','The new Shinola Monster GMT Automatic is an evolution of the iconic series.

Back then, it was all about function: Lockets, by design, had small cubbies that could carry any number of personal protections: Good luck charms, perfume diffusers, poison, portraits of your mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Queen Elizabeth I wore a locket ring with a hand-painted miniature picture of her mother on one side. With elaborate artistry and flair, the Elizabethans turned superstitious amulets into fashion. And the rest is history.  Lockets we think of today are simpler. Made from silver or gold, they might be varnished with age and contain a faded-out film photograph of a loved one—a solider out to war, a beloved daughter, a mother. These are 40’s and 50’s-era lockets, with a particularly potent nostalgia to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaf through an antique shop, and you might find one that still contains a tiny love letter, a lock of hair, or a photograph. It tells a story you can’t help but be curious about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies the lasting appeal of the heartfelt locket. No other heirloom can tell a story across generations quite like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It singles out the subjects of the portraits as uniquely loved—whether children, adults, even or man’s best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s something a phone screen could simply never do.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"792\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=491&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5368\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/picture-perfect/\">Picture Perfect</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Picture Perfect','The romantic, nostalgic appeal of locket necklaces.

This was her vision: an ethical fairtrade company that provided a market for the craft of marginalized communities. Soon after, Maison Bengal Ltd was born.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maison Bengal now works with over five thousand women throughout Bangladesh, happily able to work in their home environment enabling them to care for as well as financially support their families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why Shinola is proud to have collaborated with Maison Bengal on the design and craft for our Bengal Jute Bag.

Videos on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maisonbengal/\">the brand’s Instagram</a> show the incredible calmness, skill, and care these artisans put into weaving every single item. There is energy, joy, and laughter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To connect with these communities, Maison Bengal works very closely with three fair trade organizations in Bangladesh. Each identifies marginalized groups their area to train in the global market of handicraft production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working separately with each group, Maison Bengal translates their local materials into contemporary designs. The on-site team helps develop their unique traditional skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s taken years of commitment, but for Day, it’s a constant work in progress that’s endlessly rewarding. It’s not hard to see why: Maison Bengal has put roots into a creative community capable of incredible craftsmanship.

It’s up just past your ankles. Your attention is locked in, but you move slowly. Any flash of white, any ripple of pattern. It could be just another rock. Or it could be a stone that’s anything but ordinary. It could be a Petoskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a kid from the Midwest, this all checks out. To the rest of the world, it sounds like a geologist’s travel blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies the allure of the Petoskey Stone: Unknown by many. Cherished by few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with a time, a place, and a name. Pet-O-Sega—‘Light that is coming’—is the Indigenous Ottawan turn of phrase for the morning sun. It was given as a name to the son of an Ottawa chief’s daughter and a French fur trader. This son grew up to become a notable leader, a legend in the land’s history: Chief Petosegay. On his land at the edge of Northern Lake Michigan, a bay town at Bear Creek named itself after him: Petoskey.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-Lake.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5351\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_626206940f14c\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt- pb-\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>On beaches from Petoskey to Manistee, curious rocks wash ashore. They can be bean-sized or big as a bowling ball. They are all different shapes. Some are dark like slate, some are a light khaki. But when wet or polished, little bursts of white appear, like rays from the rising sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six-sided hexagons, to be exact. You might identify them better next to a picture of a tropical coral reef. That’s because these stones are really pieces of a millennia-old coral colony that was fossilized, broken up by glacial migration, roughed up, and then deposited up on the beach this past winter when the lake ice melted and churned the shores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are over thirty-seven thousand miles of fresh and saltwater coast in the world. Petoskeys can only be found on this roughly two hundred mile stretch of Lake Michigan, on beaches as stones and inland as complete underground colony heads.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/02-Two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=756&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5352\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_626206ac0f14d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>For me, that swath of water, sand, and forest is home. I’m not alone. Whether you call it “Up North” or your street address, this slice of the state of Michigan is like Eden, paradisial in its own salt-free way. It draws adoration from all over the state. Petoskeys are so well-known to the populace, they’re legislated. At a ceremony in 1965, they were named the state stone. Chief Petosagey’s great-granddaughter, Ella Jane Petoskey, was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was my mother who introduced me to the rarified rock. She grew up looking for them under my grandparents’—and their parents—direction. There are techniques. Methods. Rituals. It’s a tradition passed on in bare feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As kids, from dawn to dusk, Memorial through Labor Day, my brother and I could be found knee deep, locked in the high-stakes treasure hunt. Looking back, Mom must have been able to make it through two, three chapters of her beach read in one sitting of peace and quiet as we wandered head-down, in a meditative trance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a Petoskey Vinton, one of the first watches Shinola ever made with the stone. For Mother’s Day 2020, I gifted a Petoskey bead bracelet to my mother. It meant something to give a gift so rooted in our shared memories. A piece that belonged in a jeweler’s case, not a souvenir store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One that, like tradition, can be passed down as an heirloom. Summer vacations are long gone, but I still go Petoskey-hunting with mom when I can. We catch and release more than we collect these days. We have Petoskeys we keep with us, made to be worn for years to come.  There’s a moment that time stops when look for a Petoskey. Your mind is still. The breeze picks up. You see what you think is a glimmer of one. The morning tide and still-rising sun collide in a psychedelic mirage. It’s nothing—just a rock. But you look up with a smile. Your mom is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I found one,” she says.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/03-Two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=756&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5353\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/close-to-home/\">Close to Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Close to Home','Why Michigan’s Petoskey stone is so treasured.

Introducing the Traveler: A watch born out of the natural wonders of the Great Lakes and the great American road trip.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df7a39b92d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>How does an inanimate object gain character? For any product designer, giving a unique personality and identity to a thing is both a challenge and a canvas for creativity. Shinola’s latest watch, The Traveler, is case in point. It’s wanderlust personified, a study of how color, texture, material, and shape can evoke memories of a place you’ve never been—and give a watch its soul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Greg Verras, Design Director for Watches, looks back at the beginning of the Traveler, it’s touched with a tinge of irony. “We were concepting and designing throughout the early days of the pandemic. We were thinking, ‘People are gonna want to get out.’ So we started going on that journey: Imagining what it’s going to be like when we’re finally going places again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers embarked on a path to create a watch that was both elevated and road-ready, a timepiece at the intersection of travel and field. They didn’t have to look far: From Leelenau and Glen Arbor to the Sleeping Bear Dunes, inspiration flowed out of the Empire region of Lake Michigan.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"786\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-Collection.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5245\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df7ee9b92f\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>The designers hit the books, pulling cues from vintage “Travel Michigan” posters, post cards, and images from <em>Straight as the Pine, Sturdy as the Oak</em> by Michael Huey, a historical look back at the camps and locations of Northern Michigan through first-person stories and photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long a destination for travelers both local and global, Verras explained that Northern Michigan immediately provided a rich characterization for the watch. “The story began to take shape with a unique and charming warmth, rooted in nostalgia, with a vintage and classic feeling.” Early iterations of the watch even touched on Traverse—inspired by the iconic Cherry Capital of the world, Traverse City—before landing on the universal Traveler.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>The slim case profile, two-eyed chronograph details and box crystal lend the Traveler a refined persona. But it’s grounded with textures and colors that give it a friendly, everyday feel. It’s the crossroads where heritage watchmaking and contemporary design meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a watch designer, texture is one of the most immediate and literal ways of evoking a feeling. The eggshell-like dial of the Traveler calls to mind the texture and scrub of sand dunes, somehow both smooth and course at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The color story sprang from another vintage reference, one familiar to any longtime Shinola fan and historian: Willys Overland Jeeps. Designers created color studies from the more modern post-WWII customizations of those Jeeps. Another tribute to the road-trip and Willys theme: A little tail on the seconds hand is pulled straight from the dashboard speedometer.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"382\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/02-Texture-Dial.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=353&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=696&amp;wpsize=home-cat-short\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5246\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:56px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"786\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/03-Green.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=620&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5247\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df8349b930\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>As the latest in a long line of Detroit-assembled watches, made to last, the Traveler Chrono features the Argonite 5021.D movement.

The Diamond Petoskey Book timepiece is proof that if you’re in need of inspiration in Detroit—you need only look up.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b6684572a\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>A row of stately trees splits Washington Boulevard between Michigan and Grand River Avenues, just as it has for the last hundred years plus. From the Book-Cadillac Hotel to the south to the 1930’s parish across the street, the architectural atmosphere creates an aura of having stepped back in time. It’s here on the corner at 1265, overlooking the boulevards and avenues that make up Detroit city’s wheel-spoke streets, that Book Tower rises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no other skyscraper in the city—perhaps even the Midwest—that makes a mark on the skyline quite like Book Tower. Notable Detroit architect Louis Kemper is responsible for its unusual fusion of intricate romantic Renaissance style with sheer stature. At 475 feet and 38 stories high, it was the tallest skyscraper in Detroit at its completion in 1926, usurped only by the Penobscot two years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamper designed Book Tower on behalf of the Book brothers, prominent businessmen from a long line of family wealth that stretched through decades of Detroit history. Construction began as an addition to the original, much smaller Book Building—which to this day is one of the city’s oldest surviving office buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took a decade to finish. Upon close examination, it’s obvious to see why.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"1150\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/01-Architecture-Images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5216\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b72a4572b\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Book Tower was designed in the Italian-Renaissance style. It digs back into the ancient world even as it scrapes the skies through modern engineering. The touches and trademarks of Renaissance Revival abound through classical details: Corinthian columns, florets, scrolls, crests, and even a cartouche by Detroit architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. Look closely at the exterior and one will find a score of dramatic caryatids, stone carvings of draped female figures that quite literally hold the building aloft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s capped with an elegant copper roof, long since greened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for all its exterior beauty, it’s a feature on the inside of the light, open, and spacious Book Tower that inspired the design of Shinola’s latest—and most luxe to date—timepiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third-floor atrium opens up to a stunning art glass skylight, so intricate in its detail that it’s hard to imagine the sheer amount of labor and craft involved in its creation a hundred years ago. Its grandeur and elegance is the heartbeat of Book Tower—and it’s the light’s beautiful oval shape that’s at the heart of the Diamond Petoskey Book watch.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"803\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/02-Book-Comparison-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=666&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5230\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b7cb4572c\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>When first exposed to the skylight, Vice President of Product Design Brandon Little immediately asked, “What can we bring to a women’s platform that plays off the femininity of that oval atrium?” The classicism of design and innate femininity of both the Book Tower and the glass skylight gave shape—literally—to the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little says the watch team began sketching that classical oval shape, directly reminiscent of the skylight, and found that it also connected to the Shinola brand DNA in recurring ways. “The soft surfacing and shape continued the design narrative of Bike Lock and Derby,” two women’s watch platforms that pulled from the elegance of a curved lug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the shape set, completing the identity of the Book as a watch platform was a matter of details, details, details. A polished surface, petite size, and celebration of craft through stone dials and luxe materials sets the Book apart. And for this premium, skyward-inspired timepiece’s launch, no detail was overlooked.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/03-Sketches.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=809&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5218\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b7e44572d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Visually, the special edition Diamond Petoskey Book sings. The architecturally inspired 25mm case features an elegant dome-like curve. The piece is crafted from stainless steel plated with nine microns of 18k gold and one micron of 23k gold for a total thickness of ten microns, resulting in a radiant gold finish. This luxurious plating gives the Book an elevated elegance and long-lasting strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the shimmering glass and jewels of the Book Tower skylight, eighty diamonds with three-prong settings shine in a zig-zag pattern, allowing for maximum presentation and sparkle. These are high-clarity grade VS1 full-cut diamonds, among the top five percent of all gem-quality stones. They feature 58 facts each and shine brighter—literally—due to their brilliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every last Diamond Petoskey Book is unique to itself due to three finishing features: An alligator leather strap, a Petoskey stone dial, and an engravable case back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sewn in the USA with American hides, every premium grey alligator strap is one-of-a-kind in its patterns, lines, and textures. The stone dial is a tip to another Michigan icon: the Petoskey, an organic gemstone that features the fossilized remains of six-sided coral. No two are alike. And because the Diamond Petoskey Book is such a distinguished piece, it can be personalized with a sign, symbol, message, or monogram on the case back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a watch meant to be treasured; A timepiece crafted to become an heirloom; An icon on par with a one-of-a-kind skyscraper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the historic skylight? Along with the rest of Book Tower, the restoration is underway. It involves reverse-engineering the techniques used to create the components: The cast iron frame, the glass, some 7,000 jewels. It’s a delicate and complex undertaking, equal parts design and engineering, form and function, art and craft—not unlike, say, the creation of a watch.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/04-Book-Images-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=656&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5233\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/skyward-inspiration-the-design-behind-the-diamond-petoskey-book/\">Skyward Inspiration: The Design Behind the Diamond Petoskey Book</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Skyward Inspiration: The Design Behind the Diamond Petoskey Book','A hundred-year-old skyscraper.

Since the dawn of time, we’ve used leather for clothing, shelter, and currency. Everything from satchels and sheaths to designer purses and car interiors have been crafted from the natural wonder that is leather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a tradition that’s 400,000 years long. And contrary to popular belief, it shows no signs of stopping in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tanneries and manufacturers from the Midwest to the Sunshine State are preserving the skills and knowledge for a new generation of quality leathercraft. Case in point: Every piece in Shinola’s new USA Heritage Collection of leather goods is made from American leather and sewn in the United States.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"1213\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/2-Images-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5411\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b24f9f4be\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\">NOTHING TO HIDE</h2>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It all starts with North American hides. USA Heritage Leather is distinctive. Rich with oils, this leather will change and darken over time—a process known as patina—and it burnishes and embosses beautifully. As the bag or leather good ages, its character will change with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USA Heritage Leather hides are aniline and semi-aniline dyed, far gentler and more natural than the use of pigments, plastic paints, and harsh chemicals. As a result, the natural and unique characteristics of each individual hide are visible, not covered up. These “beauty marks” – think scratches, scars, and even stretch marks—are perfectly natural. It may seem counterintuitive, but they are indicators of the quality treatment of the leather that bestows a luxurious hand feel. The grain is supple and highlighted from being tumbled in dye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is opposed to many retailers that use chemical treatments, which are sprayed on the surface and strip the leather of its natural suppleness and fill the surface with particles. While this process “fills in” and covers up imperfections, it adds an unpleasant synthetic touch to the finished product. There’s nothing more natural—or premium—than a naked leather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tanning process happens at Seidel Tannery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a fourth-generation family-owned business with 75 years of experience—ten of those years in partnership with Shinola. As a specialty tanner, Seidel’s leather is made-to-order, meaning Shinola leather is treated with a specific formula to fit the needs for the USA Heritage Collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All it takes is one touch of the leather—Seidel’s commitment to excellence speaks for itself in the texture, tone, and hand feel. All hides come from U.S. domestic markets, giving Seidel the highest quality raw materials in North America and a fully traceable supply chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"858\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/Group-of-bags.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5192\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b2859f4bf\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<h2>PROUDLY HOME-SEWN</h2>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>After tanning, the leather for this collection is sewn in the USA by our partners in Florida, New Jersey, and Missouri—each with a particular calling card in their leathercraft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just off the Mississippi River in St. Genevieve, Missouri, the folks at Eric Scott have been expertly cutting and sewing leather for over three decades. Like our partners at Roma Industries in Florida, they have contributed to the Shinola story from the very beginning of our foray into leather goods. Today, they take the lead in crafting a number of our items in the collection. The intersection between old world craftsmanship and the latest sewing technology results in thoughtfully crafted leather goods of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From lanyards and key holders to passport wallets, the USA Heritage Collection benefits from Eric Scott’s close attention to detail and craftsmanship, creating a suite of everyday essentials that will put up with the rigors of everyday use—and only look all the better for it. It’s a purposeful design found in many of the pieces’ name: Utility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utility evokes classic detailing and simple archetypal hardware. It’s an aesthetic that’s both functional and stylish, rooted in an American design heritage. These bags and accessories are unlined, and it’s that very simplicity that reveals the complexity of the sewing techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unlined leather has a unique way of breaking down and softening over time. It’s beautiful to see the craftsmanship and the stitching on the inside,” says Product Development Senior Manager Gabrielle Aldridge. It’s a fitting inspiration for a collection sourced, tanned, and sewn state-side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often take for granted the ubiquitous nature of leather as an essential material. The USA Heritage Collection invites a deeper look. These everyday items were created not just as practical accessories, but as a celebration of the art and hard-earned skill of American tanneries and leatherworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>May the tradition carry on for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1610\" height=\"1073\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/SLG.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=682&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5193\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/the-heritage-of-leathercraft/\">The Heritage of Leathercraft</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','The Heritage of Leathercraft','Tanned in Milwaukee.

For the last nine years, the job of dreaming has belonged to Molly Wang, a senior designer at Shinola.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“There’s no typical day—every day is different!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">That’s how Wang describes the job, punctuating this description with a laugh. But even if variety keeps things interesting, success requires focus and balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“My role is creating beautiful watches,” Wang says. On any given day, she juggles multiple watch projects at different stages of development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">First is research: Gathering consumer insights, creating mood boards, getting inspiration such as color and seasonal palettes, then bringing it all together to create watch concepts — many, many concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“Then we come together as a team—always—to give feedback and critique,” Wang explains. They go through many rounds of ideation and modification until every member is confident in the final design. From there, it’s off to the races. Wang and team work with product development to produce first and second samples until it’s perfected for assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Wang has always been captivated by art and craft. Her passion crystalized in her early 20s as she poured her passion for art into design. Watches weren’t immediately on her radar. While pursuing her Master’s in Industrial Design, she happened to use watches as a case study and landed an internship—and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\"><p>“It’s a surprising journey for me. I never thought I would be a watch designer, but I’m enjoying it greatly. The best part is that I get to spend a lot of time just designing. Creating, being an artist—diving into my own zone. That’s really a pure joy for me.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_622653f9f98d0\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62265419f98d1\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">In recognition of International Women’s Day, we asked Wang about her experiences as a woman in the industry, and if she ever thought of herself differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“I never thought about what I should or shouldn’t do as a female—I just focused on what I would like to do as a person. I liked this industry and wanted to go for it. But I realize that it wasn’t easy for people even a couple decades ago—women were not allowed to work, culturally or otherwise, like me. So I feel grateful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">What advice does she have for the next generation of women watch designers? “I would be very happy to learn that any young girl has interest in the watch industry,” Wang gushes excitedly. “It’s such a unique industry. My experience is they could start learning the history of watchmaking—that would make them appreciate the industry, objects, and career they want to work in. So much has evolved to make it what it is today.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Fortunately for us, Molly Wang is part of that evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:55px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226532ef98ce\" class=\"color-block mb-0 color-block wp-block pt-5 pb-5\" style=\"background-color:#b0ccb4\">\n    \n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-black-color has-text-color\">BAILEY ZURAWSKI<br>VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1322\" height=\"881\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/02-Image.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=682&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5170\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226536ff98cf\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Bailey Zurawski thrives at the intersection of science and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">“At my core, I’m an ops nerd,” she laughs. “I love being in a manufacturing plant and I love seeing things get made.” It shouldn’t be a surprise that her hometown, Dearborn, Michigan, is also home to the car company that birthed the assembly line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">After studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Michigan and working operations roles, she started consulting hundreds of manufacturing plants across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">One day during a consultation, Zurawski was asked about her dream job. “I said, ‘I want to run operations for a company that I feel really passionate about, in a community that I care about, at home in Detroit. Like Shinola.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">It wasn’t long before she was living that dream. As vice president of operations “my job is to support the 150 people that call Ops home, to give them the tools, the strategies, and the goals for how to be most effective at their job. And to then in turn affect the business and how we want it to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-black-color\"><p>“Be curious and never stop learning. You’re never going to know it all. There’s always going to be someone who knows more about it than you.

The team, the team, the team. “This is the best team I’ve ever been a part of. I’ve never been at a place where people are so passionate about what they do on a day-to-day basis and care so much. That really inspires me to come in every day and do better for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Zurawski’s relative youth and gender have affected her experience to varying degrees throughout her career—but she’s learned to turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn more, create relationships, and press forward. “If you’re persistent and you make yourself a seat at the table, it helps you build credibility and keep moving through your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">For young women curious about the watchmaking industry, Zurawski has this advice: “Be curious and never stop learning. You’re never going to know it all. There’s always going to be someone who knows more about it than you. Soak it up and learn from them—it will help you figure out what you want to do, where you want to go, and what your best strengths are.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">It’s the same learning attitude that’s propelled Zurawski through her career. “Bring it on, let’s run with it and get shit done.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226548af98d5\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-5 pb-5\" style=\"background-color:#627264\">\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">KRISTEN MEROLLIS<br>PRODUCTION TEAM LEAD FOR MOVEMENTS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/K__2970-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5164\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_622654ebf98d6\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Back in 2013, Kristen Merollis got a call from a temp agency for a brand-new watchmaking company that was just starting up in Detroit. Would she be interested in joining? With her experience in quality assurance, Merollis figured it could be a great fit. Almost a decade later, she is still lending her passion for organization, quality, and people to the company where she’s found a home—and a place to grow her career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Watch movements are a world of their own, and assembling them is an intense game of “Operation” in which a single screw can be as microscopic as a piece of glitter. As the production team lead for movements, Merollis is tasked with overseeing each step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Shinola’s factory has over a dozen main stations with multiple assemblers at each, focusing on different elements of the movement—from the coil to the battery. “I set up the stations as far as tooling, making sure everyone has what they need and the right quantity,” explains Merollis. Every movement assembler has an individual “magazine” that contains the parts required for the task at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">It’s a delicate daily operation, but Merollis feels that she was made for it. “I like working with people and I’m really organized,” she laughs. But watch movements, she knows, are no joke and Merollis is at her best when making sure the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed, with everything in its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Just like her foray into the watch industry, Merollis didn’t know at first that she wanted to be in a leadership role. But after a few years at Shinola, it just clicked. “Because I like working with people and helping them, I learned over time that it was something I wanted to do.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">How has being a woman impacted Merollis’ career in the industry? “It’s affected my career at other places—but never here, which is part of why I’ve been with Shinola for so long.” But despite any difficulties faced, it’s never stopped Merollis from pursuing what she wants.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\"><p>“I know that I’m more than capable of doing whatever a man can do, so it’s never inhibited me.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62265502f98d7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">For any young women interested in the field, Merollis has words of encouragement: “Go for it. It’s something that you learn quickly, because it’s so hands on. Don’t second guess it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:63px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/04-2.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=494&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5173\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/international-womens-day-the-women-behind-the-watches/\">International Women’s Day: The Women Behind the Watches</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','International Women’s Day: The Women Behind the Watches','We take you behind the scenes of Shinola watchmaking this International Women’s Day, celebrating a few incredible women who help keep the operation ticking.

After the last ten years of honing his craft in Detroit, Shinola Watchmaker Stefan Mihoc is ready for many more to come. To him, it’s been a decade of living the dream. And it doesn’t show any signs of stopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ten years ago in Detroit, a spark was ignited and quickly transformed into a lightning bolt,” he explains, harkening to the signature Shinola bolt that stands as a symbol of quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the next ten years, the world will hear a thunder.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started when a watch factory was installed in 30,000 empty square feet in the historic Argonaut Building. Ten years later, the timekeepers of Detroit have assembled over one million watches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mihoc is just one of many original employees from the early days of Shinola who remain firmly rooted in the mission today.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/01-Stefan.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=751&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5488\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d682b53ac4\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:#f9f7f4\">\n    \n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div style=\"height:65px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lakishka McCoy, Titus Hayes, Taneisha Brown, Salah Altam, and Tae’Aunna Schumake have all had a part in building this legacy, piece by piece. Literally. They’re five of the first watch assemblers of Detroit. Now, they’re mentoring and leading the next generation—and reflecting on the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the sight of a well-loved, slightly faded New York Times advertisement, Tae’Aunna Schumake’s face lights up with recognition. It announces the original Runwell. “This brings back memories of when I first started,” she explains. Schumake’s journey with Shinola started at the dial application station of the watch assembly line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were just beginning to assemble the first watches. Seeing this, it makes me proud. The Runwell was the first.

And that’s why I’ve stayed so long.” McCoy’s journey started with an immersive and intense training under Ronda AG, a Swiss manufacturer with decades of heritage of their own. Now, she’s one of the watchful experts that oversees assembly. Looking back, she muses, “I’ve grown in a lot of ways.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would she describe the Shinola of the future? “Still shining,” she says, with a sparkle all her own.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68b053ac6\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:#f9f7f4\">\n    \n\n<div style=\"height:68px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After nine years with Shinola, Salah Altam agrees. Altam has progressed through nearly every element of the craft of watches. Starting with the hands, he moved to case back closing, and finally to the finely tuned world of repairs. Altam sees no signs of slowing down. “Every year, Shinola has grown up. We will have more watches, more projects, and continue to be great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s seconded by Taneisha Brown, an original assembler who moved into a position as a movement repair tech after a supervisor noticed her affinity for the ultra-delicate world of watch movements. “If I had one word to describe the future for Shinola, it would be indescribable,” she laughs joyfully. “Because I never know what we’re going to do next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=755&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5555\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68d853ac7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>“When I started, there was only seven or eight people hanging lights, a couple of desks, and an empty factory floor,” says Titus Hayes. Like Brown, his first role at Shinola was in movement assembly. In the last decade, he’s stepped into more and more responsibility, making his way up in his technical skills to repairs. He now oversees assembly as a production manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To see it grow, I feel I was a part of that. That’s why I stayed the last ten years. Because I wanted to be a part of something great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that after a decade in the making, it’s the people who make that greatness a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time-tested confidence, the original Runwell line will train the next generation of Shinola watch artisans, designers, and creatives.

The time displayed there, counted from midnight, is Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT. Every time zone in the world is plus or minus an hour from this baseline “zero.” Pilots call it “Zulu Time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the days of WWII, air force pilots and other military navigators carried 24-hour “G.C.T.” pocket watches set to Greenwich Central Time, as it was known then.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>But it wasn’t until the rise of intercontinental air travel that a need arose to track a local and universal time zone at once. If you’re a pilot taking off from New York and landing in Paris, you’d like to know the local time and the destination time with just a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the early 1950’s, the GMT was born: A travel watch that combines three-hand local time with an arrow-tipped GMT hand that rotates once a day, read with a 24-hour bezel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed specifically for pilots, early GMT watches prioritized high readability for quick decision making, extreme lume for dimly lit cockpits, and absolute precision for an ultra-demanding job.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"392\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/01-GCT-Pocketwatch.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=353&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=696&amp;wpsize=home-cat-short\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5417\" /><figcaption><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">An early &#8220;G.C.T.&#8221; pocket watch.</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62853eb8a0b13\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Even in today’s age of tech, GMT watches continue to provide an elegant solution for pilots, captains, travelers, and anyone with a loved one in another time zones.

The Shinola Monster GMT Automatic is part of the long-successful Monster Automatic Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">First introduced in 2017 as Shinola’s flagship automatic, the Lake Eerie Monster eventually grew into a series of Great Lakes inspired dive watches, rated at 30 ATM and testing beyond international standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Five years later, the platform takes its first step into the GMT zone, expanding what it means to be a Monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">“This is really an example of us collecting feedback from our audience, and proving that we’re listening, we hear you,” explains Director of Watch Design Greg V. “There was a strong desire for a smaller case size and an open case back window, so we found a way to do that with the Monster series in the form of a GMT travel watch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Unlike its predecessors, the GMT is a lighter-on-the-wrist travel automatic with a full exhibition case back that reveals the rotor and inner workings. The GMT boasts a 10 ATM rating and arrives with an additional woven strap. Made from upcycled #tide® ocean bound plastic, it’s breathable, waterproof, and eco-conscious. Just save the truly deep end for a Monster dive watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:63px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1074\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/03-Image-1-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=679&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5477\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1074\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Image-2-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=679&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5478\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62853f4ca0b15\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">But the Monster GMT embodies—and continues—the Shinola Monster spirit with its technical acumen and precision craftsmanship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">A Swiss-made Sellita SW330-2 movement inside has twenty-five jewels for reducing friction and holds a 56-hour power reserve. Through the power of physics and mechanical engineering, the rotor moves with its wearer, keeping the automatic movement wound. Watch it at work through the exhibition window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">Early GMT models had a fixed bezel, but with the Monster GMT’s rotating 24-hour bezel, you can track another time zone with a little addition and subtraction. The bezel, crafted with ceramic, is fine-tuned in assembly and rigorously quality-checked at the Shinola watch factory in Detroit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-text-color\">This four-handed GMT automatic arrives just shy of the factory’s ten-year anniversary. It’s a testament to past growth, from watch design to the assembly line. And it’s a glimpse of the future, taking flight.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/arrivals-and-departures-monster-gmt/\">Arrivals and Departures at the Greenwich Meridian</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Arrivals and Departures at the Greenwich Meridian','The new Shinola Monster GMT Automatic is an evolution of the iconic series.

Back then, it was all about function: Lockets, by design, had small cubbies that could carry any number of personal protections: Good luck charms, perfume diffusers, poison, portraits of your mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Queen Elizabeth I wore a locket ring with a hand-painted miniature picture of her mother on one side. With elaborate artistry and flair, the Elizabethans turned superstitious amulets into fashion. And the rest is history.  Lockets we think of today are simpler. Made from silver or gold, they might be varnished with age and contain a faded-out film photograph of a loved one—a solider out to war, a beloved daughter, a mother. These are 40’s and 50’s-era lockets, with a particularly potent nostalgia to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaf through an antique shop, and you might find one that still contains a tiny love letter, a lock of hair, or a photograph. It tells a story you can’t help but be curious about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies the lasting appeal of the heartfelt locket. No other heirloom can tell a story across generations quite like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It singles out the subjects of the portraits as uniquely loved—whether children, adults, even or man’s best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s something a phone screen could simply never do.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"792\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=491&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5368\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/picture-perfect/\">Picture Perfect</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Picture Perfect','The romantic, nostalgic appeal of locket necklaces.

This was her vision: an ethical fairtrade company that provided a market for the craft of marginalized communities. Soon after, Maison Bengal Ltd was born.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maison Bengal now works with over five thousand women throughout Bangladesh, happily able to work in their home environment enabling them to care for as well as financially support their families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why Shinola is proud to have collaborated with Maison Bengal on the design and craft for our Bengal Jute Bag.

Videos on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maisonbengal/\">the brand’s Instagram</a> show the incredible calmness, skill, and care these artisans put into weaving every single item. There is energy, joy, and laughter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To connect with these communities, Maison Bengal works very closely with three fair trade organizations in Bangladesh. Each identifies marginalized groups their area to train in the global market of handicraft production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working separately with each group, Maison Bengal translates their local materials into contemporary designs. The on-site team helps develop their unique traditional skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s taken years of commitment, but for Day, it’s a constant work in progress that’s endlessly rewarding. It’s not hard to see why: Maison Bengal has put roots into a creative community capable of incredible craftsmanship.

It’s up just past your ankles. Your attention is locked in, but you move slowly. Any flash of white, any ripple of pattern. It could be just another rock. Or it could be a stone that’s anything but ordinary. It could be a Petoskey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a kid from the Midwest, this all checks out. To the rest of the world, it sounds like a geologist’s travel blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies the allure of the Petoskey Stone: Unknown by many. Cherished by few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with a time, a place, and a name. Pet-O-Sega—‘Light that is coming’—is the Indigenous Ottawan turn of phrase for the morning sun. It was given as a name to the son of an Ottawa chief’s daughter and a French fur trader. This son grew up to become a notable leader, a legend in the land’s history: Chief Petosegay. On his land at the edge of Northern Lake Michigan, a bay town at Bear Creek named itself after him: Petoskey.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-Lake.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5351\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_626206940f14c\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt- pb-\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>On beaches from Petoskey to Manistee, curious rocks wash ashore. They can be bean-sized or big as a bowling ball. They are all different shapes. Some are dark like slate, some are a light khaki. But when wet or polished, little bursts of white appear, like rays from the rising sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six-sided hexagons, to be exact. You might identify them better next to a picture of a tropical coral reef. That’s because these stones are really pieces of a millennia-old coral colony that was fossilized, broken up by glacial migration, roughed up, and then deposited up on the beach this past winter when the lake ice melted and churned the shores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are over thirty-seven thousand miles of fresh and saltwater coast in the world. Petoskeys can only be found on this roughly two hundred mile stretch of Lake Michigan, on beaches as stones and inland as complete underground colony heads.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/02-Two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=756&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5352\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_626206ac0f14d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>For me, that swath of water, sand, and forest is home. I’m not alone. Whether you call it “Up North” or your street address, this slice of the state of Michigan is like Eden, paradisial in its own salt-free way. It draws adoration from all over the state. Petoskeys are so well-known to the populace, they’re legislated. At a ceremony in 1965, they were named the state stone. Chief Petosagey’s great-granddaughter, Ella Jane Petoskey, was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was my mother who introduced me to the rarified rock. She grew up looking for them under my grandparents’—and their parents—direction. There are techniques. Methods. Rituals. It’s a tradition passed on in bare feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As kids, from dawn to dusk, Memorial through Labor Day, my brother and I could be found knee deep, locked in the high-stakes treasure hunt. Looking back, Mom must have been able to make it through two, three chapters of her beach read in one sitting of peace and quiet as we wandered head-down, in a meditative trance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a Petoskey Vinton, one of the first watches Shinola ever made with the stone. For Mother’s Day 2020, I gifted a Petoskey bead bracelet to my mother. It meant something to give a gift so rooted in our shared memories. A piece that belonged in a jeweler’s case, not a souvenir store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One that, like tradition, can be passed down as an heirloom. Summer vacations are long gone, but I still go Petoskey-hunting with mom when I can. We catch and release more than we collect these days. We have Petoskeys we keep with us, made to be worn for years to come.  There’s a moment that time stops when look for a Petoskey. Your mind is still. The breeze picks up. You see what you think is a glimmer of one. The morning tide and still-rising sun collide in a psychedelic mirage. It’s nothing—just a rock. But you look up with a smile. Your mom is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I found one,” she says.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/03-Two-images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=756&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5353\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/close-to-home/\">Close to Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Close to Home','Why Michigan’s Petoskey stone is so treasured.

Introducing the Traveler: A watch born out of the natural wonders of the Great Lakes and the great American road trip.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df7a39b92d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>How does an inanimate object gain character? For any product designer, giving a unique personality and identity to a thing is both a challenge and a canvas for creativity. Shinola’s latest watch, The Traveler, is case in point. It’s wanderlust personified, a study of how color, texture, material, and shape can evoke memories of a place you’ve never been—and give a watch its soul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Greg Verras, Design Director for Watches, looks back at the beginning of the Traveler, it’s touched with a tinge of irony. “We were concepting and designing throughout the early days of the pandemic. We were thinking, ‘People are gonna want to get out.’ So we started going on that journey: Imagining what it’s going to be like when we’re finally going places again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers embarked on a path to create a watch that was both elevated and road-ready, a timepiece at the intersection of travel and field. They didn’t have to look far: From Leelenau and Glen Arbor to the Sleeping Bear Dunes, inspiration flowed out of the Empire region of Lake Michigan.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"786\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/01-Collection.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5245\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df7ee9b92f\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>The designers hit the books, pulling cues from vintage “Travel Michigan” posters, post cards, and images from <em>Straight as the Pine, Sturdy as the Oak</em> by Michael Huey, a historical look back at the camps and locations of Northern Michigan through first-person stories and photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long a destination for travelers both local and global, Verras explained that Northern Michigan immediately provided a rich characterization for the watch. “The story began to take shape with a unique and charming warmth, rooted in nostalgia, with a vintage and classic feeling.” Early iterations of the watch even touched on Traverse—inspired by the iconic Cherry Capital of the world, Traverse City—before landing on the universal Traveler.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns two-col-image-right-small\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>The slim case profile, two-eyed chronograph details and box crystal lend the Traveler a refined persona. But it’s grounded with textures and colors that give it a friendly, everyday feel. It’s the crossroads where heritage watchmaking and contemporary design meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a watch designer, texture is one of the most immediate and literal ways of evoking a feeling. The eggshell-like dial of the Traveler calls to mind the texture and scrub of sand dunes, somehow both smooth and course at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The color story sprang from another vintage reference, one familiar to any longtime Shinola fan and historian: Willys Overland Jeeps. Designers created color studies from the more modern post-WWII customizations of those Jeeps. Another tribute to the road-trip and Willys theme: A little tail on the seconds hand is pulled straight from the dashboard speedometer.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"382\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/02-Texture-Dial.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=353&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=696&amp;wpsize=home-cat-short\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5246\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:56px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"786\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/04/03-Green.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=620&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5247\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_624df8349b930\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>As the latest in a long line of Detroit-assembled watches, made to last, the Traveler Chrono features the Argonite 5021.D movement.

The Diamond Petoskey Book timepiece is proof that if you’re in need of inspiration in Detroit—you need only look up.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b6684572a\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>A row of stately trees splits Washington Boulevard between Michigan and Grand River Avenues, just as it has for the last hundred years plus. From the Book-Cadillac Hotel to the south to the 1930’s parish across the street, the architectural atmosphere creates an aura of having stepped back in time. It’s here on the corner at 1265, overlooking the boulevards and avenues that make up Detroit city’s wheel-spoke streets, that Book Tower rises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no other skyscraper in the city—perhaps even the Midwest—that makes a mark on the skyline quite like Book Tower. Notable Detroit architect Louis Kemper is responsible for its unusual fusion of intricate romantic Renaissance style with sheer stature. At 475 feet and 38 stories high, it was the tallest skyscraper in Detroit at its completion in 1926, usurped only by the Penobscot two years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamper designed Book Tower on behalf of the Book brothers, prominent businessmen from a long line of family wealth that stretched through decades of Detroit history. Construction began as an addition to the original, much smaller Book Building—which to this day is one of the city’s oldest surviving office buildings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took a decade to finish. Upon close examination, it’s obvious to see why.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"1150\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/01-Architecture-Images.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5216\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b72a4572b\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Book Tower was designed in the Italian-Renaissance style. It digs back into the ancient world even as it scrapes the skies through modern engineering. The touches and trademarks of Renaissance Revival abound through classical details: Corinthian columns, florets, scrolls, crests, and even a cartouche by Detroit architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. Look closely at the exterior and one will find a score of dramatic caryatids, stone carvings of draped female figures that quite literally hold the building aloft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s capped with an elegant copper roof, long since greened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for all its exterior beauty, it’s a feature on the inside of the light, open, and spacious Book Tower that inspired the design of Shinola’s latest—and most luxe to date—timepiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third-floor atrium opens up to a stunning art glass skylight, so intricate in its detail that it’s hard to imagine the sheer amount of labor and craft involved in its creation a hundred years ago. Its grandeur and elegance is the heartbeat of Book Tower—and it’s the light’s beautiful oval shape that’s at the heart of the Diamond Petoskey Book watch.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"803\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/02-Book-Comparison-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=666&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5230\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b7cb4572c\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>When first exposed to the skylight, Vice President of Product Design Brandon Little immediately asked, “What can we bring to a women’s platform that plays off the femininity of that oval atrium?” The classicism of design and innate femininity of both the Book Tower and the glass skylight gave shape—literally—to the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little says the watch team began sketching that classical oval shape, directly reminiscent of the skylight, and found that it also connected to the Shinola brand DNA in recurring ways. “The soft surfacing and shape continued the design narrative of Bike Lock and Derby,” two women’s watch platforms that pulled from the elegance of a curved lug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the shape set, completing the identity of the Book as a watch platform was a matter of details, details, details. A polished surface, petite size, and celebration of craft through stone dials and luxe materials sets the Book apart. And for this premium, skyward-inspired timepiece’s launch, no detail was overlooked.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/03-Sketches.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=809&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5218\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b7e44572d\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Visually, the special edition Diamond Petoskey Book sings. The architecturally inspired 25mm case features an elegant dome-like curve. The piece is crafted from stainless steel plated with nine microns of 18k gold and one micron of 23k gold for a total thickness of ten microns, resulting in a radiant gold finish. This luxurious plating gives the Book an elevated elegance and long-lasting strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the shimmering glass and jewels of the Book Tower skylight, eighty diamonds with three-prong settings shine in a zig-zag pattern, allowing for maximum presentation and sparkle. These are high-clarity grade VS1 full-cut diamonds, among the top five percent of all gem-quality stones. They feature 58 facts each and shine brighter—literally—due to their brilliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every last Diamond Petoskey Book is unique to itself due to three finishing features: An alligator leather strap, a Petoskey stone dial, and an engravable case back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sewn in the USA with American hides, every premium grey alligator strap is one-of-a-kind in its patterns, lines, and textures. The stone dial is a tip to another Michigan icon: the Petoskey, an organic gemstone that features the fossilized remains of six-sided coral. No two are alike. And because the Diamond Petoskey Book is such a distinguished piece, it can be personalized with a sign, symbol, message, or monogram on the case back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a watch meant to be treasured; A timepiece crafted to become an heirloom; An icon on par with a one-of-a-kind skyscraper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the historic skylight? Along with the rest of Book Tower, the restoration is underway. It involves reverse-engineering the techniques used to create the components: The cast iron frame, the glass, some 7,000 jewels. It’s a delicate and complex undertaking, equal parts design and engineering, form and function, art and craft—not unlike, say, the creation of a watch.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/04-Book-Images-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=656&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5233\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/skyward-inspiration-the-design-behind-the-diamond-petoskey-book/\">Skyward Inspiration: The Design Behind the Diamond Petoskey Book</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','Skyward Inspiration: The Design Behind the Diamond Petoskey Book','A hundred-year-old skyscraper.

Shinola’s latest leather collection proves that the art of leathercraft is far from over in the USA.</pre>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b1b19f4bd\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p>Next to carpentry, leathercraft is one of the most ancient trades known to humankind. Since the dawn of time, we’ve used leather for clothing, shelter, and currency. Everything from satchels and sheaths to designer purses and car interiors have been crafted from the natural wonder that is leather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a tradition that’s 400,000 years long. And contrary to popular belief, it shows no signs of stopping in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tanneries and manufacturers from the Midwest to the Sunshine State are preserving the skills and knowledge for a new generation of quality leathercraft. Case in point: Every piece in Shinola’s new USA Heritage Collection of leather goods is made from American leather and sewn in the United States.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"1213\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/2-Images-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5411\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6238b24f9f4be\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\">NOTHING TO HIDE</h2>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It all starts with North American hides. USA Heritage Leather is distinctive. Rich with oils, this leather will change and darken over time—a process known as patina—and it burnishes and embosses beautifully. As the bag or leather good ages, its character will change with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USA Heritage Leather hides are aniline and semi-aniline dyed, far gentler and more natural than the use of pigments, plastic paints, and harsh chemicals. As a result, the natural and unique characteristics of each individual hide are visible, not covered up. These “beauty marks” – think scratches, scars, and even stretch marks—are perfectly natural. It may seem counterintuitive, but they are indicators of the quality treatment of the leather that bestows a luxurious hand feel. The grain is supple and highlighted from being tumbled in dye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is opposed to many retailers that use chemical treatments, which are sprayed on the surface and strip the leather of its natural suppleness and fill the surface with particles. While this process “fills in” and covers up imperfections, it adds an unpleasant synthetic touch to the finished product. There’s nothing more natural—or premium—than a naked leather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tanning process happens at Seidel Tannery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a fourth-generation family-owned business with 75 years of experience—ten of those years in partnership with Shinola. As a specialty tanner, Seidel’s leather is made-to-order, meaning Shinola leather is treated with a specific formula to fit the needs for the USA Heritage Collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All it takes is one touch of the leather—Seidel’s commitment to excellence speaks for itself in the texture, tone, and hand feel.

Today, they take the lead in crafting a number of our items in the collection. The intersection between old world craftsmanship and the latest sewing technology results in thoughtfully crafted leather goods of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From lanyards and key holders to passport wallets, the USA Heritage Collection benefits from Eric Scott’s close attention to detail and craftsmanship, creating a suite of everyday essentials that will put up with the rigors of everyday use—and only look all the better for it. It’s a purposeful design found in many of the pieces’ name: Utility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utility evokes classic detailing and simple archetypal hardware. It’s an aesthetic that’s both functional and stylish, rooted in an American design heritage. These bags and accessories are unlined, and it’s that very simplicity that reveals the complexity of the sewing techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unlined leather has a unique way of breaking down and softening over time. It’s beautiful to see the craftsmanship and the stitching on the inside,” says Product Development Senior Manager Gabrielle Aldridge. It’s a fitting inspiration for a collection sourced, tanned, and sewn state-side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often take for granted the ubiquitous nature of leather as an essential material. The USA Heritage Collection invites a deeper look. These everyday items were created not just as practical accessories, but as a celebration of the art and hard-earned skill of American tanneries and leatherworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>May the tradition carry on for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1610\" height=\"1073\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/SLG.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=682&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5193\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/the-heritage-of-leathercraft/\">The Heritage of Leathercraft</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','The Heritage of Leathercraft','Tanned in Milwaukee.

For the last nine years, the job of dreaming has belonged to Molly Wang, a senior designer at Shinola.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“There’s no typical day—every day is different!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">That’s how Wang describes the job, punctuating this description with a laugh. But even if variety keeps things interesting, success requires focus and balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“My role is creating beautiful watches,” Wang says. On any given day, she juggles multiple watch projects at different stages of development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">First is research: Gathering consumer insights, creating mood boards, getting inspiration such as color and seasonal palettes, then bringing it all together to create watch concepts — many, many concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“Then we come together as a team—always—to give feedback and critique,” Wang explains. They go through many rounds of ideation and modification until every member is confident in the final design. From there, it’s off to the races. Wang and team work with product development to produce first and second samples until it’s perfected for assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Wang has always been captivated by art and craft. Her passion crystalized in her early 20s as she poured her passion for art into design. Watches weren’t immediately on her radar. While pursuing her Master’s in Industrial Design, she happened to use watches as a case study and landed an internship—and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\"><p>“It’s a surprising journey for me. I never thought I would be a watch designer, but I’m enjoying it greatly. The best part is that I get to spend a lot of time just designing. Creating, being an artist—diving into my own zone. That’s really a pure joy for me.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_622653f9f98d0\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62265419f98d1\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">In recognition of International Women’s Day, we asked Wang about her experiences as a woman in the industry, and if she ever thought of herself differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">“I never thought about what I should or shouldn’t do as a female—I just focused on what I would like to do as a person. I liked this industry and wanted to go for it. But I realize that it wasn’t easy for people even a couple decades ago—women were not allowed to work, culturally or otherwise, like me. So I feel grateful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">What advice does she have for the next generation of women watch designers? “I would be very happy to learn that any young girl has interest in the watch industry,” Wang gushes excitedly. “It’s such a unique industry. My experience is they could start learning the history of watchmaking—that would make them appreciate the industry, objects, and career they want to work in. So much has evolved to make it what it is today.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Fortunately for us, Molly Wang is part of that evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:55px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226532ef98ce\" class=\"color-block mb-0 color-block wp-block pt-5 pb-5\" style=\"background-color:#b0ccb4\">\n    \n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-black-color has-text-color\">BAILEY ZURAWSKI<br>VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1322\" height=\"881\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/02-Image.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=682&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5170\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226536ff98cf\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Bailey Zurawski thrives at the intersection of science and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">“At my core, I’m an ops nerd,” she laughs. “I love being in a manufacturing plant and I love seeing things get made.” It shouldn’t be a surprise that her hometown, Dearborn, Michigan, is also home to the car company that birthed the assembly line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">After studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Michigan and working operations roles, she started consulting hundreds of manufacturing plants across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">One day during a consultation, Zurawski was asked about her dream job. “I said, ‘I want to run operations for a company that I feel really passionate about, in a community that I care about, at home in Detroit. Like Shinola.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">It wasn’t long before she was living that dream. As vice president of operations “my job is to support the 150 people that call Ops home, to give them the tools, the strategies, and the goals for how to be most effective at their job. And to then in turn affect the business and how we want it to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-black-color\"><p>“Be curious and never stop learning. You’re never going to know it all. There’s always going to be someone who knows more about it than you. Soak it up and learn from them—it will help you figure out what you want to do, where you want to go, and what your best strengths are.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226545ef98d2\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">So, what does a typical day of this dream job entail?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">“That changes every single day—whether it’s being on the phone with a supplier who isn’t delivering, to planning a training for my team, to doing a production walk to understand the issues going on the line and how we can eliminate them.” If a curveball is thrown at the makers of Shinola, it’s Zurawski’s responsibility to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Zurawski is no stranger to curveballs: She started in January 2020—just weeks before Covid-19 gripped the world. “We took a six-week hiatus when the pandemic started, but since then have been coming into work every single day.” She’s been an essential lead in coordinating logistics as the manufacturing environment moves beyond the most acute phases of the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Her favorite part of the role? The team, the team, the team. “This is the best team I’ve ever been a part of. I’ve never been at a place where people are so passionate about what they do on a day-to-day basis and care so much. That really inspires me to come in every day and do better for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Zurawski’s relative youth and gender have affected her experience to varying degrees throughout her career—but she’s learned to turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn more, create relationships, and press forward. “If you’re persistent and you make yourself a seat at the table, it helps you build credibility and keep moving through your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">For young women curious about the watchmaking industry, Zurawski has this advice: “Be curious and never stop learning. You’re never going to know it all. There’s always going to be someone who knows more about it than you. Soak it up and learn from them—it will help you figure out what you want to do, where you want to go, and what your best strengths are.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">It’s the same learning attitude that’s propelled Zurawski through her career. “Bring it on, let’s run with it and get shit done.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_6226548af98d5\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-5 pb-5\" style=\"background-color:#627264\">\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">KRISTEN MEROLLIS<br>PRODUCTION TEAM LEAD FOR MOVEMENTS</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/K__2970-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=683&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5164\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_622654ebf98d6\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Back in 2013, Kristen Merollis got a call from a temp agency for a brand-new watchmaking company that was just starting up in Detroit. Would she be interested in joining? With her experience in quality assurance, Merollis figured it could be a great fit. Almost a decade later, she is still lending her passion for organization, quality, and people to the company where she’s found a home—and a place to grow her career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Watch movements are a world of their own, and assembling them is an intense game of “Operation” in which a single screw can be as microscopic as a piece of glitter. As the production team lead for movements, Merollis is tasked with overseeing each step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Shinola’s factory has over a dozen main stations with multiple assemblers at each, focusing on different elements of the movement—from the coil to the battery. “I set up the stations as far as tooling, making sure everyone has what they need and the right quantity,” explains Merollis. Every movement assembler has an individual “magazine” that contains the parts required for the task at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">It’s a delicate daily operation, but Merollis feels that she was made for it. “I like working with people and I’m really organized,” she laughs. But watch movements, she knows, are no joke and Merollis is at her best when making sure the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed, with everything in its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">Just like her foray into the watch industry, Merollis didn’t know at first that she wanted to be in a leadership role. But after a few years at Shinola, it just clicked. “Because I like working with people and helping them, I learned over time that it was something I wanted to do.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">How has being a woman impacted Merollis’ career in the industry? “It’s affected my career at other places—but never here, which is part of why I’ve been with Shinola for so long.” But despite any difficulties faced, it’s never stopped Merollis from pursuing what she wants.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\"><p>“I know that I’m more than capable of doing whatever a man can do, so it’s never inhibited me.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_62265502f98d7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:\">\n    \n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#f4f1e7\">For any young women interested in the field, Merollis has words of encouragement: “Go for it. It’s something that you learn quickly, because it’s so hands on. Don’t second guess it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:63px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/03/04-2.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=494&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5173\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/international-womens-day-the-women-behind-the-watches/\">International Women’s Day: The Women Behind the Watches</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p>\n','International Women’s Day: The Women Behind the Watches','We take you behind the scenes of Shinola watchmaking this International Women’s Day, celebrating a few incredible women who help keep the operation ticking.

Like Brown, his first role at Shinola was in movement assembly. In the last decade, he’s stepped into more and more responsibility, making his way up in his technical skills to repairs. He now oversees assembly as a production manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To see it grow, I feel I was a part of that. That’s why I stayed the last ten years.

And it doesn’t show any signs of stopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ten years ago in Detroit, a spark was ignited and quickly transformed into a lightning bolt,” he explains, harkening to the signature Shinola bolt that stands as a symbol of quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the next ten years, the world will hear a thunder.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started when a watch factory was installed in 30,000 empty square feet in the historic Argonaut Building.

We will have more watches, more projects, and continue to be great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s seconded by Taneisha Brown, an original assembler who moved into a position as a movement repair tech after a supervisor noticed her affinity for the ultra-delicate world of watch movements. “If I had one word to describe the future for Shinola, it would be indescribable,” she laughs joyfully. “Because I never know what we’re going to do next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=755&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5555\" srcset=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=221&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=111&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=150&amp;wpsize=thumbnail 150w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=566&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=935&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=cat-feature-mobile 1024w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=1133&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=1510&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0 815w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68d853ac7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:;\">\n    \n\n<p>“When I started, there was only seven or eight people hanging lights, a couple of desks, and an empty factory floor,” says Titus Hayes. Like Brown, his first role at Shinola was in movement assembly. In the last decade, he’s stepped into more and more responsibility, making his way up in his technical skills to repairs. He now oversees assembly as a production manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To see it grow, I feel I was a part of that. That’s why I stayed the last ten years.

We will have more watches, more projects, and continue to be great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s seconded by Taneisha Brown, an original assembler who moved into a position as a movement repair tech after a supervisor noticed her affinity for the ultra-delicate world of watch movements. “If I had one word to describe the future for Shinola, it would be indescribable,” she laughs joyfully. “Because I never know what we’re going to do next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"815\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=755&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5555\" srcset=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=221&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=111&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=150&amp;wpsize=thumbnail 150w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=566&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=935&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=cat-feature-mobile 1024w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=1133&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=1510&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/04-Salah-1.png?auto=format&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0 815w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"shinola-block_628d68d853ac7\" class=\"color-block color-block wp-block pt-2 pb-2\" style=\"background-color:;\">\n    \n\n<p>“When I started, there was only seven or eight people hanging lights, a couple of desks, and an empty factory floor,” says Titus Hayes. Like Brown, his first role at Shinola was in movement assembly. In the last decade, he’s stepped into more and more responsibility, making his way up in his technical skills to repairs. He now oversees assembly as a production manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To see it grow, I feel I was a part of that. That’s why I stayed the last ten years. Because I wanted to be a part of something great.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that after a decade in the making, it’s the people who make that greatness a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time-tested confidence, the original Runwell line will train the next generation of Shinola watch artisans, designers, and creatives. And they’ll train the next wave after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the next wave after that.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large image-768 is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"809\" height=\"793\" src=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=702&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=890&amp;wpsize=home-feature-mobile\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5556\" srcset=\"https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=294&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=147&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=150&amp;wpsize=thumbnail 150w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=753&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=935&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=cat-feature-mobile 1024w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=1506&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=2007&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://shinola-wordpress.imgix.net/2022/05/06-Titus-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0 809w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px\"></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/the-timekeepers-of-detroit/\">The Timekeepers of Detroit</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shinola.com/our-stories\">Our Stories</a>.</p></div>','The Timekeepers of Detroit','','inherit','closed','closed','','38-revision-v1','','','2022-06-01 19:16:23','2022-06-01 19:16:23','',38,'http://shinola-take-home-assesment.local/?p=50',0,'revision','',0);
